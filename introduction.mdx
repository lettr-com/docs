description: "Lettr is the email API for developers"
---

Lettr is an email infrastructure platform built for developers who need reliable, scalable email delivery without the complexity. Whether you're sending transactional emails like password resets and order confirmations, or building sophisticated email workflows with tracking and analytics, Lettr provides the APIs and tools to get it done.

Email delivery is deceptively complex. Between authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, reputation management, bounce handling, and the ever-changing landscape of spam filtering, building reliable email infrastructure from scratch is a significant undertaking. Lettr handles this complexity so you can focus on your application.
