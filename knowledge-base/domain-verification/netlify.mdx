# Verify Your Domain on Netlify

This guide walks you through adding DNS records for Lettr using Netlify DNS.

<Info>
  This guide is for domains using Netlify DNS. If you only have a site on Netlify but your DNS is managed elsewhere, use the guide for your DNS provider instead.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- A domain configured with Netlify DNS
- Access to your Netlify account
- A Lettr account with your domain added

## Step 1: Add Domain to Lettr

1. Log in to your [Lettr dashboard](https://app.lettr.com)
2. Navigate to **Domains**
3. Click **Add Domain**
4. Enter your domain name and select the domain type
5. Copy the DNS records provided

## Step 2: Access Netlify DNS

1. Log in to your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click **Domains** in the top navigation
3. Select your domain from the list
4. You'll see the DNS records panel

## Step 3: Sending Domain Setup

Choose the setup that matches your needs:

### Option A: Subdomain (Recommended)

Use a subdomain like `sender.example.com` for sending emails.

#### Bounce Domain CNAME

1. Click **Add new record**
2. Select **CNAME** as the record type
3. Enter `sender` in the **Name** field (or your chosen subdomain)
4. Enter `sparkpostmail.com` in the **Value** field
5. Click **Save**

| Netlify | Lettr | Example Value |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Name | Host | `sender` |
| Value | Value | `sparkpostmail.com` |

### Option B: Primary Domain

Use your root domain with TXT SPF verification.

#### SPF Record

1. Click **Add new record**
2. Select **TXT** as the record type
3. Leave the **Name** field empty (for root domain)
4. Enter `v=spf1 include:_spf.sparkpostmail.com ~all` in the **Value** field
5. Click **Save**

| Netlify | Lettr | Example Value |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Name | Host | (empty for root) |
| Value | Value | `v=spf1 include:_spf.sparkpostmail.com ~all` |

<Warning>
  If you already have an SPF record, merge it by adding `include:_spf.sparkpostmail.com` before the `~all` or `-all` mechanism.
</Warning>

### DKIM Record (Required for both options)

1. Click **Add new record**
2. Select **TXT** as the record type
3. Enter the DKIM hostname from your Lettr dashboard (e.g., `scph0226._domainkey.sender`)
4. Enter the DKIM value from your dashboard
5. Click **Save**

| Netlify | Lettr | Example Value |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Name | Host | `scph0226._domainkey.sender` |
| Value | Value | `v=DKIM1;k=rsa;h=sha256;p=MIGf...` |

### DMARC Record (Required for both options)

1. Click **Add new record**
2. Select **TXT** as the record type
3. Enter `_dmarc.sender` (subdomain) or `_dmarc` (root domain) in the **Name** field
4. Enter `v=DMARC1;p=none;` in the **Value** field
5. Click **Save**

| Netlify | Lettr | Example Value |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Name | Host | `_dmarc.sender` or `_dmarc` |
| Value | Value | `v=DMARC1;p=none;` |

## Step 4: Tracking Domain Setup

Custom tracking domains require two CNAME records.

### SSL Certificate CNAME

1. Click **Add new record**
2. Select **CNAME** as the record type
3. Enter the SSL verification hostname from your dashboard (e.g., `_acme-challenge.click.sender`)
4. Enter the SSL verification value from your dashboard
5. Click **Save**

### Traffic CNAME

1. Click **Add new record**
2. Select **CNAME** as the record type
3. Enter your tracking subdomain (e.g., `click.sender`)
4. Enter `proxy.lettr-tracking.com` in the **Value** field
5. Click **Save**

| Netlify | Lettr | Example Value |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Name | Host | `click.sender` |
| Value | Value | `proxy.lettr-tracking.com` |

<Tip>
  SSL certificates are automatically generated and renewed by Lettr.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Inbound Domain Setup

To receive emails at your domain, add MX records.

1. Click **Add new record**
2. Select **MX** as the record type
3. Enter `inbound` in the **Name** field (or your chosen subdomain)
4. Enter `10 rx1.sparkpostmail.com` in the **Value** field
5. Click **Save**
6. Repeat for `rx2.sparkpostmail.com` and `rx3.sparkpostmail.com`

| Netlify Name | Priority | Value |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| `inbound` | 10 | `rx1.sparkpostmail.com` |
| `inbound` | 10 | `rx2.sparkpostmail.com` |
| `inbound` | 10 | `rx3.sparkpostmail.com` |

<Note>
  Netlify MX records may require the priority in the value field as `10 rx1.sparkpostmail.com`.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Use a subdomain like `inbound.example.com` for receiving emails. Using your root domain will route ALL email to Lettr.
</Warning>

## Step 6: Complete Verification

1. Return to your [Lettr dashboard](https://app.lettr.com)
2. Navigate to **Domains**
3. Click **Verify** next to your domain
4. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 1-15 minutes for Netlify)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DNS records not propagating">
    Netlify DNS typically propagates very quickly. If records aren't showing:
    - Double-check the record values for typos
    - Ensure you're using Netlify DNS (check nameservers)
    - Wait a few more minutes and try again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflict with existing Netlify site">
    If you have a Netlify site at the same subdomain, you may need to remove or reconfigure it before adding email-related DNS records.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Root domain CNAME issues">
    Netlify uses ALIAS records for root domains. For email, use the subdomain approach or TXT SPF verification.
  </Accordion>
