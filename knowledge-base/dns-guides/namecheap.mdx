---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Namecheap's DNS management. Namecheap is a popular domain registrar that offers DNS hosting for domains registered through its [Namecheap Account Panel](https://www.namecheap.com).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.

This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.

### Configure Namecheap DNS

Log in to your [Namecheap Account Panel](https://www.namecheap.com) and navigate to **Domain List**. Click **Manage** next to your domain, then select the **Advanced DNS** tab.

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through Namecheap or your nameservers already point to Namecheap, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using Namecheap's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Namecheap, you must first transfer the domain to
    Namecheap or **update the nameservers** at your registrar to Namecheap's nameservers.

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in Namecheap will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  Namecheap automatically appends your domain to the host value. When entering hostnames, paste only the subdomain portion
  (e.g. `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`). If you paste the full hostname, the resulting record will be
  `mailing.company.com.company.com`, which will fail verification.
</Info>

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
6. Click the **checkmark** to save.

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
6. Click the **checkmark** to save.

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
6. Click the **checkmark** to save.

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.

Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.

This will display the MX records that need to be configured.

### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Before adding MX records, ensure that Namecheap's mail settings are configured correctly. In the **Advanced DNS** tab, scroll down to the **MAIL SETTINGS** section. Open the **Email Forwarding** drop-down and select **Custom MX** — otherwise Namecheap's default mail settings will take precedence over any custom MX records you add.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **MX**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
4. Copy the first MX record value from Lettr (e.g. `rx1.sparkpostmail.com`) and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Set **Priority** to `10`.
6. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
7. Click the **checkmark** to save.
8. Repeat this process for the second (`rx2.sparkpostmail.com`) and third (`rx3.sparkpostmail.com`) MX records, each with priority `10`.

<Warning>
  All emails sent to the domain or subdomain where MX records are configured will be routed to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.

This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
6. Click the **checkmark** to save.

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
6. Click the **checkmark** to save.

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.

This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
6. Click the **checkmark** to save.

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
6. Click the **checkmark** to save.

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Namecheap:

1. Click **ADD NEW RECORD** in the Advanced DNS tab.
2. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (Automatic).
6. Click the **checkmark** to save.

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Suffix Not Omitted">
    Namecheap automatically appends your domain to the Host field. If you paste the full hostname (e.g.
    `mailing.company.com`), the resulting record will be `mailing.company.com.company.com`, which will fail verification.

    Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g. `mailing`, `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, `_dmarc.mailing`). If you made
    this mistake, delete the incorrect record and re-add it with only the subdomain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MX Records Not Working">
    If your inbound MX records are not resolving, confirm that Namecheap's mail settings are configured for custom
    records. In the **Advanced DNS** tab, scroll down to the **MAIL SETTINGS** section. Open the **Email Forwarding**
    drop-down and select **Custom MX**. The default setting will override any custom MX records you add.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    Namecheap DNS propagation typically takes up to 72 hours but is often much faster. If verification fails after adding
    records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 1–2 hours** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to Namecheap">
    If your records are saved in Namecheap but not resolving, confirm that your domain registrar is pointing to
    Namecheap's nameservers. You can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include Namecheap's nameservers (e.g. `dns1.registrar-servers.com`, `dns2.registrar-servers.com`).
    If the output shows a different provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar to point to Namecheap.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CNAME at Root Domain Not Supported">
    Standard CNAME records cannot be used at the root of a domain (e.g. `company.com`). Namecheap does not allow CNAME
    records at the apex (`@`) — attempting to add one will fail. Always use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) for
    your sending, tracking, and storage domains. Namecheap does offer ALIAS records at the root as an alternative, but
    Lettr's verification requires a standard CNAME, so a subdomain is required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong type from the dropdown:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CNAME Conflict">
    If a CNAME record fails to save or resolve, check whether an existing A or CNAME record already uses the same
    hostname. Namecheap does not automatically remove conflicting records. Delete any duplicate or conflicting records for
    the same hostname before adding the new CNAME.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string (often 400+ characters). After saving the record, click the **Edit** pencil icon
    next to it and confirm the full value is present in the **Value** field. If it appears cut off, delete the record and
    re-add it, pasting the complete value carefully. Namecheap supports up to 2500 characters in the Value field, so the
    full DKIM key fits without splitting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after
    48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the
    output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
