description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on Linode DNS Manager."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Linode DNS Manager (now part of Akamai). Linode is a cloud infrastructure provider that offers DNS hosting through the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.


This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.


### Configure Linode DNS

Log in to the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com) and click **Domains** in the left sidebar. Select your domain from the list to open the DNS records management page.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Linode Domains page */}

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through Linode or your nameservers already point to Linode, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using Linode's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Linode, you must first **update the nameservers**
    at your registrar to Linode's nameservers (`ns1.linode.com` through `ns5.linode.com`).

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in Linode will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Linode nameserver configuration inside the accordion above */}

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to Linode:

1. Click **Add a CNAME Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field in Linode (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
3. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Alias to** field in Linode.
4. Set **TTL** to **Default** (or your preferred value).
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of CNAME record in Linode DNS Manager */}

<Info>
  Linode automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Linode:

1. Click **Add a TXT Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field in Linode (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
3. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field in Linode.
4. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DKIM TXT record in Linode DNS Manager */}

<Info>
  DKIM values are long strings. Linode handles long TXT records automatically — enter the complete value without
  line breaks.
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Linode:

1. Click **Add a TXT Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field in Linode (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
3. Copy the **Value** from Lettr (e.g. `v=DMARC1;p=none;`) and paste it into the **Value** field in Linode.
4. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DMARC TXT record in Linode DNS Manager */}

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within 5–30 minutes for Linode.


---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.


Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.


This will display the MX records that need to be configured.


### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to Linode:

1. Click **Add a MX Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field in Linode (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
3. Copy the first **Required MX Record** value (without the priority number) from Lettr and paste it into the **Mail Server** field in Linode.
4. Set **Preference** to `10`.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Repeat this process for the second (`rx2.sparkpostmail.com`) and third (`rx3.sparkpostmail.com`) MX records, each with preference `10`.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of MX records in Linode DNS Manager */}

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a domain or subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within 5–30 minutes for Linode.


---

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.


This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.


### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Linode:

1. Click **Add a CNAME Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Alias to** field.
4. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of SSL Certificate CNAME record in Linode DNS Manager */}

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Linode:

1. Click **Add a CNAME Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Alias to** field.
4. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Traffic CNAME record in Linode DNS Manager */}

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.


---

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.


This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.


### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Linode:

1. Click **Add a TXT Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
4. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Certificate Validation TXT record in Linode DNS Manager */}

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Linode:

1. Click **Add a TXT Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field.
4. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Hostname Pre-validation TXT record in Linode DNS Manager */}

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Linode:

1. Click **Add a CNAME Record**.
2. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Alias to** field.
4. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Domain Routing CNAME record in Linode DNS Manager */}

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    Linode DNS typically propagates within 5–30 minutes. If verification fails after adding records, check the
    following:

    - **Wait at least 30 minutes** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [WhatsMyDNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net) or [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CNAME at Root Domain Not Supported">
    Linode doesn't support CNAME records at the root domain. Use a subdomain for your sending domain
    (e.g. `mailing.company.com`). This is also a DNS protocol limitation — CNAME records cannot coexist with other
    record types at the same name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to Linode">
    If your records are saved in Linode but not resolving, confirm that your domain registrar is pointing to Linode's
    nameservers. You can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include Linode nameservers (`ns1.linode.com` through `ns5.linode.com`). If it shows a different
    provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong record type:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record, re-open it to confirm the full value was stored. If
    it appears truncated, delete the record and re-add it, pasting the full value carefully. Linode handles long TXT
    records automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails
    after 48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name
    and the output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
