description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on Strato."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Strato's DNS management. Strato is a German web hosting and domain provider that offers DNS hosting for domains managed through its [Strato Control Panel](https://www.strato.de/apps/CustomerService).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.

This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.

### Configure Strato DNS

Log in to the [Strato Control Panel](https://www.strato.de/apps/CustomerService) and navigate to **Domains** → **Domainverwaltung** (Domain Management). Click the gear icon next to your domain and select the **DNS** tab to open the DNS editor.

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through Strato or your nameservers already point to Strato, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using Strato's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Strato, you must first **update the nameservers**
    at your registrar to Strato's nameservers:

    - `ns1.strato.de`
    - `ns2.strato.de`
    - `ns4.strato.de`

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in Strato will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to Strato:

1. In the DNS editor, click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record).
2. Set **Typ** (Type) to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Präfix** (Prefix) field — without your domain suffix. For example, paste only `mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Wert** (Value) field.
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

<Info>
  Strato automatically appends your domain to the Präfix field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Strato:

1. In the DNS editor, click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record).
2. Set **Typ** (Type) to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Präfix** (Prefix) field — without your domain suffix. For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Wert** (Value) field.
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

<Info>
  DKIM records are case-sensitive. Copy the value exactly using the copy icon in your Lettr dashboard. Strato supports
  multiple TXT records on the same hostname, so this record will not conflict with existing TXT records.
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Strato:

1. In the DNS editor, click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record).
2. Set **Typ** (Type) to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Präfix** (Prefix) field — without your domain suffix. For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Wert** (Value) field (e.g. `v=DMARC1;p=none;`).
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation on Strato can take up to 24 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes to a few hours.

---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.

Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.

This will display the MX records that need to be configured.

### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Strato uses a dedicated MX configuration dialog. In the DNS tab, click **verwalten** (manage) next to the MX record row, then enable **Eigener Mailserver** (Own mail server) to configure custom MX entries.

Add the MX records for your inbound subdomain:

1. In the MX configuration dialog, enable **Eigener Mailserver** (Own mail server).
2. Enter `rx1.sparkpostmail.com.` (with trailing dot) as the mail server hostname.
3. Set **Priorität** (Priority) to `10`.
4. Click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record) and repeat for `rx2.sparkpostmail.com.` and `rx3.sparkpostmail.com.`, each with priority `10`.
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

<Info>
  Strato requires a trailing dot on MX record hostnames (e.g. `rx1.sparkpostmail.com.`). Without it, the record may
  not resolve correctly.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a domain or subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Enabling
  **Eigener Mailserver** disables Strato's mail handling for that subdomain. Use a dedicated subdomain (e.g.
  `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation on Strato can take up to 24 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes to a few hours.

---

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.

This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS editor, click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record).
2. Set **Typ** (Type) to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Präfix** (Prefix) field — without your domain suffix.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Wert** (Value) field.
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

<Info>
  Strato automatically appends your domain to the Präfix field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `tracking`, not `tracking.company.com`).
</Info>

<Warning>
  Strato does not allow a CNAME record to coexist with other record types (A, MX, TXT) on the same hostname. If the
  subdomain already has other records, you may need to remove them or use a different subdomain.
</Warning>

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS editor, click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record).
2. Set **Typ** (Type) to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Präfix** (Prefix) field — without your domain suffix.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Wert** (Value) field.
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

<Info>
  Strato automatically appends your domain to the Präfix field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `tracking`, not `tracking.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

---

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.

This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS editor, click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record).
2. Set **Typ** (Type) to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Präfix** (Prefix) field — without your domain suffix.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Wert** (Value) field.
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

<Info>
  Strato automatically appends your domain to the Präfix field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `assets`, not `assets.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS editor, click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record).
2. Set **Typ** (Type) to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Präfix** (Prefix) field — without your domain suffix.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Wert** (Value) field.
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

<Info>
  Strato supports multiple TXT records on the same hostname — add each record separately using the **+ Weiteren Record
  erstellen** button.
</Info>

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS editor, click **+ Weiteren Record erstellen** (Create another record).
2. Set **Typ** (Type) to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Präfix** (Prefix) field — without your domain suffix.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Wert** (Value) field.
5. Click **Einstellungen übernehmen** (Apply settings).

<Info>
  Strato automatically appends your domain to the Präfix field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `assets`, not `assets.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Suffix Not Omitted">
    Strato automatically appends your domain to the Präfix (Prefix) field. If you paste the full hostname (e.g.
    `mailing.company.com`), the resulting record will resolve as `mailing.company.com.company.com`, which will fail
    verification.

    Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g. `mailing`, `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, `_dmarc.mailing`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    DNS propagation on Strato can take up to 24 hours. If verification fails after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 2–4 hours** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to Strato">
    If your records are saved in Strato but not resolving, confirm that your domain is using Strato's nameservers. You can
    check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include Strato nameservers (e.g. `ns1.strato.de`, `ns2.strato.de`, `ns4.strato.de`). If it shows a
    different provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CNAME Conflicts with Existing Records">
    Strato does not allow a CNAME record to coexist with other record types (A, MX, TXT) on the same hostname. Adding
    a CNAME will deactivate all other DNS settings for that exact subdomain. If you need CNAME records for Lettr on a
    subdomain that already has other records, use a different subdomain or remove the conflicting records first.

    Additionally, CNAME records are not available at the root domain (e.g. `company.com`) in Strato — you must always
    use a subdomain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong record type in the **Typ** dropdown:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MX Record Not Accepting Custom Values">
    Strato configures its own mail server for domains by default. To add custom MX records, navigate to the MX
    configuration dialog (click **verwalten** next to MX records in the DNS tab) and enable **Eigener Mailserver**
    (Own mail server). Without this step, Strato will not allow custom MX entries.

    Also ensure that mail server hostnames include a trailing dot (e.g. `rx1.sparkpostmail.com.`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record, re-open the DNS editor and confirm the full value is
    displayed. If it appears truncated, delete the record and re-add it, pasting the full value carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after
    48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the
    output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
