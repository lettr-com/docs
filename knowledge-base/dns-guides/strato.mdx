description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on Strato."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Strato's DNS management. Strato is a German web hosting and domain provider that offers DNS hosting for domains managed through its [Strato Control Panel](https://www.strato.de).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

<Info>
  By default, Strato domains use Strato's mail server. For sending domains, you may need to create a subdomain and
  configure DNS records there to avoid conflicts with Strato's default mail configuration.
</Info>

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.


This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.


### Configure Strato DNS

Log in to your [Strato Control Panel](https://www.strato.de) and navigate to **Domains** → **Manage Domain**. Select your domain and access its DNS settings. For subdomains, you may need to first create the subdomain in Strato, then navigate to the subdomain's settings and open the **DNS** tab.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Strato DNS management page */}

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through Strato or your nameservers already point to Strato, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using Strato's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Strato, you must first **update the nameservers**
    at your registrar to Strato's nameservers shown in your domain configuration.

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in Strato will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Strato nameserver configuration inside the accordion above */}

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of CNAME record in Strato */}

<Info>
  Strato automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DKIM TXT record in Strato */}

<Info>
  DKIM records are case-sensitive. Copy the value exactly using the copy icon in your Lettr dashboard.
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr (e.g. `v=DMARC1;p=none;`).
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DMARC TXT record in Strato */}

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.


---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.


Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.


This will display the MX records that need to be configured.


### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

For inbound subdomains on Strato, you may need to first create the subdomain, navigate to the subdomain's settings, go to the **DNS** tab, click **manage** on MX records, and select **own mail server** before adding the records.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
3. Set **Type** to **MX**.
4. Set **Value** to `rx1.sparkpostmail.com`.
5. Set **Priority** to `10`.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Repeat this process for the second (`rx2.sparkpostmail.com`) and third (`rx3.sparkpostmail.com`) MX records, each with priority `10`.

<Info>
  Strato may require a trailing period on MX values (e.g. `rx1.sparkpostmail.com.`). Try adding it if verification
  fails.
</Info>


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of MX records in Strato */}

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a domain or subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.


This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.


### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of SSL Certificate CNAME record in Strato */}

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Traffic CNAME record in Strato */}

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.


This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.


### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Certificate Validation TXT record in Strato */}

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Hostname Pre-validation TXT record in Strato */}

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Strato:

1. In the DNS settings, click **Add record**.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Domain Routing CNAME record in Strato */}

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    Strato DNS propagation can take several hours. If verification fails after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 2–4 hours** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [WhatsMyDNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net) or [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to Strato">
    If your records are saved in Strato but not resolving, confirm that your domain is using Strato's nameservers. You can
    check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include Strato nameservers. If it shows a different provider's nameservers, update them in your domain
    registrar settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong record type:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflict with Strato Mail Server">
    Strato domains use Strato's mail server by default. If you encounter conflicts when adding sending or inbound
    records, create a dedicated subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com` or `inbound.company.com`) to avoid interfering
    with Strato's default mail configuration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record, re-open the DNS settings and confirm the full value is
    displayed. If it appears truncated, delete the record and re-add it, pasting the full value carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after
    48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the
    output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
