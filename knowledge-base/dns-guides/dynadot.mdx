description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on Dynadot."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Dynadot's DNS management. Dynadot is a domain registrar that offers DNS hosting for domains registered through its [Dynadot account](https://www.dynadot.com).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list. This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.

### Configure Dynadot DNS

Log in to your [Dynadot account](https://www.dynadot.com) and navigate to **My Domains** → **Manage Domains**. Check the box next to your domain, click the **Action** button above the domain list, and select **DNS Settings** from the dropdown. On the DNS settings page, select **Dynadot DNS** from the top dropdown menu if it is not already selected.

<Tip>
  If your domain was registered through Dynadot or your nameservers already point to Dynadot (`ns1.dyna-ns.net` and
  `ns2.dyna-ns.net`), skip nameserver configuration entirely — proceed directly to adding the DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Dynadot, you must first **update the nameservers**
    at your registrar to Dynadot's nameservers:

    ```
    ns1.dyna-ns.net
    ns2.dyna-ns.net
    ```

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated at your registrar, any records you add in Dynadot will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **CNAME**.
4. Paste the **Value** from Lettr into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Click **Save DNS**.

<Info>
  Dynadot automatically appends your domain to the Subdomain field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

<Warning>
  Do not add a CNAME record at the root of your domain (e.g. `company.com`). Like all standard DNS providers, Dynadot
  does not support CNAME records at the root because they conflict with the NS and SOA records required for DNS to
  function. Always use a subdomain for your sending, tracking, and storage domains.
</Warning>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **TXT**.
4. Paste the **Value** from Lettr into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Click **Save DNS**.

<Info>
  Dynadot automatically appends your domain to the Subdomain field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, not `scph0126._domainkey.mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **TXT**.
4. Paste the **Value** from Lettr into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Click **Save DNS**.

<Info>
  Dynadot automatically appends your domain to the Subdomain field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `_dmarc.mailing`, not `_dmarc.mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS changes on Dynadot propagate in as little as 5 minutes, though it can take up to 48 hours for external resolvers to pick up the changes.

---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.

Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list. This will display the MX records that need to be configured.

### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **MX**.
4. Enter `rx1.sparkpostmail.com` into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Set the **Distance** field to `10`. (Dynadot uses "Distance" instead of "Priority" — they are equivalent.)
6. Click **Save DNS**.
7. Repeat this process for the second (`rx2.sparkpostmail.com`) and third (`rx3.sparkpostmail.com`) MX records, each with Distance `10`.

<Info>
  Dynadot labels the MX priority field **Distance** rather than **Priority**. Set it to `10` for all three records, as
  Lettr's MX records are equal-priority. Do not add a trailing period to the MX values — Dynadot handles this
  automatically.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a domain or subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS changes on Dynadot propagate in as little as 5 minutes, though it can take up to 48 hours for external resolvers.

---

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list. This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **CNAME**.
4. Paste the **Value** from Lettr into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Click **Save DNS**.

<Info>
  Dynadot automatically appends your domain to the Subdomain field. Always paste only the subdomain portion.
</Info>

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **CNAME**.
4. Paste the **Value** from Lettr into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Click **Save DNS**.

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

---

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list. This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **TXT**.
4. Paste the **Value** from Lettr into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Click **Save DNS**.

<Info>
  Dynadot automatically appends your domain to the Subdomain field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `assets`, not `assets.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **TXT**.
4. Paste the **Value** from Lettr into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Click **Save DNS**.

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Dynadot:

1. On the DNS Settings page, scroll down to the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section.
2. In an empty row, enter the **Hostname** from Lettr into the **Subdomain** field (without your domain suffix).
3. Set the **Record Type** dropdown to **CNAME**.
4. Paste the **Value** from Lettr into the **IP Address or Target Host** field.
5. Click **Save DNS**.

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Suffix Not Omitted">
    Dynadot automatically appends your domain to the **Subdomain** field. If you paste the full hostname (e.g.
    `mailing.company.com`), the resulting record will resolve as `mailing.company.com.company.com`, which will fail
    verification.

    Always paste only the subdomain portion:
    - Sending CNAME: `mailing`
    - DKIM: `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`
    - DMARC: `_dmarc.mailing`
    - Inbound: `inbound`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    Dynadot's default TTL is 300 seconds (5 minutes). Changes typically propagate within minutes on Dynadot's own
    nameservers, but external resolvers that have already cached a record will hold their own TTL before refreshing.
    Propagation can take up to 48 hours globally.

    If verification fails after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 15–30 minutes** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to Dynadot">
    If your records are saved in Dynadot but not resolving, confirm that your domain is using Dynadot's nameservers. You
    can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include Dynadot's nameservers:

    ```
    ns1.dyna-ns.net
    ns2.dyna-ns.net
    ```

    If it shows a different provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar. Nameserver changes can take
    4–72 hours to propagate globally.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type or Section">
    A common mistake in Dynadot is either selecting the wrong **Record Type** in the dropdown or entering a record in
    the **Domain Record** section (intended for root-level records) instead of the **Subdomain Records** section.

    All Lettr records should be entered in the **Subdomain Records (optional)** section using these types:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string (256+ characters). After clicking **Save DNS**, navigate back to the DNS Settings
    page and confirm the full value is stored in the **IP Address or Target Host** field. If it appears truncated, delete
    the record and re-add it, pasting the complete value from Lettr in one operation. Dynadot's DNS interface does not
    impose a UI character limit beyond the DNS protocol standard, so paste the value as a single unbroken string.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MX Priority Field Shows 'Distance'">
    Dynadot labels the MX priority field **Distance** instead of the more common term **Priority**. These are
    equivalent — set **Distance** to `10` for all three Lettr MX records. Using equal distance values (10/10/10) allows
    mail servers to distribute load evenly across all three Lettr inbound servers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails
    after 48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name
    and the output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
