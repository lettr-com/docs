description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on Squarespace."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Squarespace's DNS management. Squarespace is a website builder and hosting platform that also offers DNS hosting for domains managed through its [Squarespace Domains panel](https://account.squarespace.com/domains).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.


This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.


### Configure Squarespace DNS

Log in to your [Squarespace account](https://account.squarespace.com/domains), click the domain you want to configure, then click **DNS** in the side panel, followed by **DNS Settings**.

<Info>
  Squarespace only allows custom DNS records for domains purchased or managed through Squarespace. If your domain is
  registered elsewhere, you may need to transfer it to Squarespace or update your nameservers before adding records.
</Info>

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through Squarespace or your nameservers already point to Squarespace, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using Squarespace's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Squarespace, you must first transfer the domain to
    Squarespace or **update the nameservers** at your registrar to Squarespace's nameservers (`ns1.squarespace-dns.com`
    and `ns2.squarespace-dns.com`).

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in Squarespace will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Alias Data** field.
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>
  Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Text** field.
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>
  Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, not `scph0126._domainkey.mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Text** field (e.g. `v=DMARC1;p=none;`).
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>
  Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `_dmarc.mailing`, not `_dmarc.mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.


---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.


Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.


This will display the MX records that need to be configured.


### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **MX**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
4. Copy the first MX record value from Lettr (e.g. `rx1.sparkpostmail.com`) and paste it into the **Mail Server** field.
5. Set **Priority** to `10`.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Repeat this process for the second (`rx2.sparkpostmail.com`) and third (`rx3.sparkpostmail.com`) MX records, each with priority `10`.

<Info>
  Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `inbound`, not `inbound.company.com`).
</Info>

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a domain or subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.


This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.


### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Alias Data** field.
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>
  Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `tracking`, not `tracking.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Alias Data** field.
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>
  Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `tracking`, not `tracking.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.


---

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.


This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.


### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Text** field.
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion, just as with the CNAME record above.</Info>

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Text** field.
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion, just as with the CNAME record above.</Info>

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Squarespace:

1. Click **Add record** in the DNS Settings panel.
2. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Host** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Alias Data** field.
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>
  Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `assets`, not `assets.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Suffix Not Omitted">
    Squarespace automatically appends your domain to the Host field. If you paste the full hostname (e.g. `mailing.company.com`), the resulting record will be `mailing.company.com.company.com`, which will fail verification.

    Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g. `mailing`, `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, `_dmarc.mailing`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    Squarespace DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours. If verification fails after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 2–4 hours** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [WhatsMyDNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net) or [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot Add Custom Records">
    Squarespace only supports custom DNS records for domains purchased or managed through Squarespace. If you are unable to
    add records, confirm that your domain is managed by Squarespace. If it is registered elsewhere, consider transferring it
    to Squarespace or pointing your nameservers to Squarespace before adding records.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Host Error on TXT Records">
    Squarespace will display a **"This host is already in use"** error if you attempt to add a second TXT record with an
    identical Host value. Each hostname can only hold one TXT record in Squarespace's DNS panel (with the exception of
    SPF records, which Squarespace merges automatically).

    If you need to add multiple TXT records for the same subdomain, consider managing DNS with a provider that supports
    multiple TXT records on the same hostname, such as Cloudflare or DigitalOcean.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong record type:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record, re-open the DNS Settings panel and confirm the full
    value is displayed. If it appears truncated, delete the record and re-add it, pasting the full value carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to Squarespace">
    If your records are saved in Squarespace but not resolving, confirm that your domain registrar is pointing to
    Squarespace's nameservers. You can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include Squarespace nameservers (e.g. `ns1.squarespace-dns.com`, `ns2.squarespace-dns.com`). If it
    shows a different provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after
    48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the
    output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
