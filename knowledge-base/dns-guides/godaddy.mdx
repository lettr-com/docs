description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on GoDaddy."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using GoDaddy's DNS management. GoDaddy is a domain registrar and web hosting provider that offers DNS management through its account dashboard at [dcc.godaddy.com](https://dcc.godaddy.com).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

### Add Domain to Lettr

Log in to your Lettr account and add a domain. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel, or click **Add a domain** on the Dashboard.

<img src="/images/lettr-dashboard-add-domain.png" alt="Lettr dashboard showing the Add Domain option" />

Select **Sending Domains** and click **Create Sending Domain**.

<img src="/images/lettr-create-sending-domain.png" alt="Create Sending Domain button in Lettr" />

In the modal window, enter your domain name and click **Create Domain**.

<Tip>
Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Lettr will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values in the next steps.

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-config.png" alt="DNS records displayed in Lettr after creating a sending domain" />

### Configure GoDaddy DNS

Log in to your [GoDaddy account](https://dcc.godaddy.com) and navigate to **My Products**. Find your domain in the list and click **DNS** (or click the three-dot menu and select **Manage DNS**).

{/* Provider-specific screenshot to be added */}

This opens the DNS Management page, which displays all existing DNS records for your domain.

{/* Provider-specific screenshot to be added */}

### Which setup applies to you?

Not sure which nameservers your domain is using? Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
dig NS yourdomain.com +short
```

If the output shows GoDaddy nameservers (e.g. `ns51.domaincontrol.com`, `ns52.domaincontrol.com`), your domain is already pointing to GoDaddy. If it shows a different provider's nameservers, you will need to update them.

| Your situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| Domain registered and DNS managed on GoDaddy | Skip nameserver changes — proceed directly to [adding DNS records below](#add-cname-record) |
| Domain registered elsewhere, DNS managed on GoDaddy | Update nameservers at your registrar to GoDaddy's nameservers, then add DNS records below |
| Domain registered on GoDaddy, DNS managed elsewhere | Add the Lettr DNS records at your current DNS provider instead of in GoDaddy |

<Info>
**Domain registered with a different registrar?** If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on GoDaddy, you must first update the nameservers at your registrar to GoDaddy's nameservers (e.g. `ns51.domaincontrol.com`, `ns52.domaincontrol.com`). Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in GoDaddy will not resolve.
</Info>

<Tip>
**Domain already on GoDaddy?** If your domain was purchased through GoDaddy and you have not changed the nameservers, skip nameserver configuration entirely. GoDaddy manages DNS for its own domains by default — proceed directly to adding the DNS records below.
</Tip>

Now, copy the DNS records from Lettr to GoDaddy one by one, following the instructions below.

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to GoDaddy:

1. Click **Add New Record** on the DNS Management page.
2. Select **CNAME** from the **Type** dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in GoDaddy.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field in GoDaddy.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default (typically 1 Hour).
6. Click **Save**.

<Info>
Omit your domain suffix from the Hostname when pasting into GoDaddy. For example, instead of `mailing.lettr-demo.com`, paste only `mailing`. GoDaddy automatically appends your domain to the record name.
</Info>

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-1.png" alt="CNAME record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />
{/* Provider-specific screenshot to be added */}

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to GoDaddy:

1. Click **Add New Record** on the DNS Management page.
2. Select **TXT** from the **Type** dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in GoDaddy.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field in GoDaddy.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default.
6. Click **Save**.

<Info>
Omit your domain suffix from the Hostname when pasting into GoDaddy. For example, instead of `scph0126._domainkey.mailing.lettr-demo.com`, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
</Info>

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-2.png" alt="DKIM TXT record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />
{/* Provider-specific screenshot to be added */}

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to GoDaddy:

1. Click **Add New Record** on the DNS Management page.
2. Select **TXT** from the **Type** dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in GoDaddy.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field in GoDaddy.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default.
6. Click **Save**.

<Info>
Omit your domain suffix from the Hostname when pasting into GoDaddy. For example, instead of `_dmarc.mailing.lettr-demo.com`, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
</Info>

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-3.png" alt="DMARC TXT record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />
{/* Provider-specific screenshot to be added */}

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

Select **Inbound Domains** when creating a domain in Lettr.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-new.png" alt="Creating a new inbound domain in Lettr" />

Click on the name of your new domain in the Inbound Domains list to open the domain details page.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-list-new.png" alt="Inbound domain listed in Lettr domain list" />

This will display the MX records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values in the next steps.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-config.png" alt="MX record configuration displayed in Lettr for inbound domain" />

### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to GoDaddy:

1. Click **Add New Record** on the DNS Management page.
2. Select **MX** from the **Type** dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in GoDaddy.
4. Copy the **Priority** number (e.g. `10`) from Lettr and paste it into the **Priority** field in GoDaddy.
5. Copy the first **Required MX Record** value (without the priority number) from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field in GoDaddy.
6. Leave **TTL** set to the default.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Repeat this process for the second (rx2.sparkpostmail.com) and third (rx3.sparkpostmail.com) MX records.

<Warning>
GoDaddy may have default MX records (e.g. pointing to GoDaddy's own mail servers). If you are not using GoDaddy email, delete or update these existing MX records before adding the Lettr MX records to avoid mail delivery conflicts.
</Warning>

<Info>
Omit your domain suffix from the Hostname when pasting into GoDaddy. For example, instead of `inbound.lettr-demo.com`, paste only `inbound`.
</Info>

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-1.png" alt="MX record values in Lettr for inbound domain" />
{/* Provider-specific screenshot to be added */}

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-verified.png" alt="Inbound domain verified successfully in Lettr" />

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

In the Lettr dashboard, select **Domains** in the navigation panel, then select **Tracking Domains** and click **Create Tracking Domain**. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `track.company.com`) and click **Create Tracking Domain**.

<img src="/images/lettr-add-tracking.png" alt="Creating a new tracking domain in Lettr" />

Click on the name of your new Tracking domain in the list of Tracking Domains.

<img src="/images/lettr-tracking-list.png" alt="Tracking domain listed in Lettr domain list" />

This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values in the next steps.

<img src="/images/lettr-tracking-config.png" alt="Creating a new tracking domain in Lettr" />

### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in GoDaddy:

1. Click **Add New Record** on the DNS Management page.
2. Select **CNAME** from the **Type** dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in GoDaddy.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field in GoDaddy.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default.
6. Click **Save**.

<Info>

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

In the Lettr dashboard, select **Domains** in the navigation panel, then select **Storage Domains** and click **Create Storage Domain**. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`) and click **Create Storage Domain**.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-new.png" alt="Creating a new storage domain in Lettr" />

Click on the name of your new domain in the Storage Domains list to open the domain details page.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-list-new.png" alt="Storage domain listed in Lettr domain list" />

This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values in the next steps.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-config.png" alt="Storage domain configuration in Lettr" />

### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in GoDaddy:

1. Click **Add New Record** on the DNS Management page.
2. Select **TXT** from the **Type** dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in GoDaddy.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field in GoDaddy.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default.
6. Click **Save**.

<Info>
Omit your domain suffix from the Hostname when pasting into GoDaddy, just as with the CNAME record above.
</Info>

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-1.png" alt="Certificate Validation TXT record values in Lettr for storage domain" />
{/* Provider-specific screenshot to be added */}

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in GoDaddy:

1. Click **Add New Record** on the DNS Management page.
2. Select **TXT** from the **Type** dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in GoDaddy.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Value** field in GoDaddy.
5. Leave **TTL** set to the default.
6. Click **Save**.

<Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Suffix Not Omitted">
    GoDaddy automatically appends your domain to the record name. If you paste the full hostname (e.g. `mailing.lettr-demo.com`), the resulting record will be `mailing.lettr-demo.com.lettr-demo.com`, which will fail verification.

    Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g. `mailing`, `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, `_dmarc.mailing`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflicting Default MX Records">
    GoDaddy often includes default MX records pointing to its own mail servers (e.g. `mailstore1.secureserver.net`). If these remain alongside the Lettr MX records, mail delivery may be unpredictable. If you are using a subdomain for inbound email (e.g. `inbound.company.com`), the default MX records on the root domain will not conflict. If you are using the root domain, delete the default GoDaddy MX records before adding the Lettr records.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="TXT Record Character Limit">
    GoDaddy has a 1024-character limit for individual TXT record values in some configurations. DKIM values can exceed this limit. If GoDaddy truncates the value or shows an error when saving, try the following:

    - Split the value into two quoted strings separated by a space (e.g. `"first-half" "second-half"`). GoDaddy may concatenate them automatically.
    - If splitting does not work, contact GoDaddy support to increase the TXT record value limit for your domain.

    <Warning>
    If GoDaddy truncates your DKIM TXT value, DKIM verification will fail. Always confirm the full value was saved by editing the record after creation.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    If verification fails after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 30 minutes** before your first verification attempt. Most records propagate within 1–2 hours.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong type in GoDaddy's Type dropdown:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record in GoDaddy, click the pencil icon to edit the record and confirm the full value was stored. If it appears truncated, see the TXT Record Character Limit section above.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Domain Forwarding or Parking Interference">
    If your domain has GoDaddy's domain forwarding or parking enabled, it may add extra DNS records (such as A records or CNAME records for `@`) that interfere with your Lettr configuration. Disable domain forwarding and parking in GoDaddy's domain settings before adding Lettr DNS records.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to GoDaddy">
    If your domain is registered with GoDaddy but you have previously changed the nameservers to another provider, your DNS records in GoDaddy will not resolve. You can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include GoDaddy nameservers (e.g. `ns51.domaincontrol.com`, `ns52.domaincontrol.com`). If it shows a different provider's nameservers, either update them back to GoDaddy or add the Lettr DNS records at your current DNS provider instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after 48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
