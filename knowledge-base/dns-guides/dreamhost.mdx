---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using DreamHost's DNS management. DreamHost is a web hosting provider that offers DNS hosting for domains registered or managed through its [DreamHost Panel](https://panel.dreamhost.com).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list. This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.

### Configure DreamHost DNS

Log in to the [DreamHost Panel](https://panel.dreamhost.com) and navigate to **Websites** → **Manage Websites**. Find your domain and click the **⋮** (three-dot) button to the right of it, then select **DNS Settings** from the menu.

<Tip>
  If your domain was registered through DreamHost or your nameservers already point to DreamHost, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely — proceed directly to adding the DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on DreamHost, you must first add the domain to your
    DreamHost account (set to **DNS Only** mode) and then **update the nameservers** at your registrar to DreamHost's
    nameservers:

    ```
    ns1.dreamhost.com
    ns2.dreamhost.com
    ns3.dreamhost.com
    ```

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated at your registrar, any records you add in DreamHost will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **CNAME** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
4. Set **Points to** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  DreamHost automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`). DreamHost does not expose a TTL field — it defaults to 5 minutes internally.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Do not add a CNAME record at the root of your domain (e.g. `company.com`). DreamHost does not support CNAME records
  at the root, and attempting to do so will produce an error. Always use a subdomain for your sending domain.
</Warning>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **TXT** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
4. Set **TXT Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  DreamHost automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, not `scph0126._domainkey.mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **TXT** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
4. Set **TXT Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  DreamHost automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `_dmarc.mailing`, not `_dmarc.mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation typically completes within a few hours on DreamHost, though it can take up to 48 hours for external resolvers to pick up the changes.

---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.

Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list. This will display the MX records that need to be configured.

### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **MX** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
4. Set **Points to** to `rx1.sparkpostmail.com`.
5. Set **Priority** to `10`.
6. Click **Add Record**.
7. Repeat this process for the second (`rx2.sparkpostmail.com`) and third (`rx3.sparkpostmail.com`) MX records, each with priority `10`.

<Info>
  DreamHost automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `inbound`, not `inbound.company.com`). Do not add a trailing period to the MX values — DreamHost handles this automatically.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Use a dedicated subdomain
  (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid interfering with DreamHost's own email services or your existing mail setup.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation typically completes within a few hours, though it can take up to 48 hours for external resolvers.

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list. This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **CNAME** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
4. Set **Points to** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  DreamHost automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion.
</Info>

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **CNAME** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
4. Set **Points to** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Add Record**.

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

---

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list. This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **TXT** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
4. Set **TXT Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  DreamHost automatically appends your domain to the Host field. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `assets`, not `assets.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **TXT** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
4. Set **TXT Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Add Record**.

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in DreamHost:

1. Click **Add Record** on the DNS Settings page.
2. Select **CNAME** as the record type.
3. Set **Host** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
4. Set **Points to** to the **Value** from Lettr.
5. Click **Add Record**.

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Suffix Not Omitted">
    DreamHost automatically appends your domain to the **Host** field. If you paste the full hostname (e.g.
    `mailing.company.com`), the resulting record will resolve as `mailing.company.com.company.com`, which will fail
    verification.

    Always paste only the subdomain portion:
    - Sending CNAME: `mailing`
    - DKIM: `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`
    - DMARC: `_dmarc.mailing`
    - Inbound: `inbound`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    DreamHost DNS changes are applied quickly within their own infrastructure (default TTL is 5 minutes), but external
    resolvers that have already cached a record will hold their own TTL before refreshing. Propagation typically completes
    within a few hours but can take up to 48 hours.

    If verification fails after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 1–2 hours** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to DreamHost">
    If your records are saved in DreamHost but not resolving, confirm that your domain registrar is pointing to
    DreamHost's nameservers. You can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include DreamHost's nameservers:

    ```
    ns1.dreamhost.com
    ns2.dreamhost.com
    ns3.dreamhost.com
    ```

    If it shows a different provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar. Nameserver changes can take
    4–72 hours to propagate globally.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CNAME at Root Domain Not Supported">
    DreamHost does not support CNAME records at the root of a domain (e.g. `company.com`). You must use a subdomain for
    your sending, tracking, and storage domains. This is also a DNS protocol constraint — CNAME records cannot coexist
    with any other record type at the same name.

    If DreamHost shows a conflict error when adding a CNAME, check whether an existing A record or another CNAME is
    already present for that subdomain and remove it first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong record type when clicking **Add Record**:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record, navigate back to the DNS Settings page for your domain
    and locate the record to confirm the full value was stored. If it appears truncated, delete the record and re-add it,
    pasting the complete value from Lettr. DreamHost's DNS panel handles long TXT values without chunking — paste the
    value as a single string.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails
    after 48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name
    and the output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
