description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on Azure DNS."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Microsoft Azure DNS. Azure DNS is a reliable, fast DNS service built on Microsoft's global network of name servers, managed through the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<img src="/images/lettr-create-sending-domain.png" alt="Create Sending Domain button in Lettr" />

<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.

<img src="/images/lettr-sending-list.png" alt="Sending domain listed in Lettr Sending Domains list" />

This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-config.png" alt="DNS records displayed in Lettr after creating a sending domain" />

### Configure Azure DNS

Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to **Azure DNS** in the left-hand menu. Click **DNS zones** to view your zones, and select the zone that matches your domain.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Azure DNS zones list */}

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through Azure or your nameservers already point to Azure DNS, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using Azure DNS's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Azure, you must first create a DNS zone in Azure DNS
    and then **update the nameservers** at your registrar to Azure's nameservers shown in the zone overview.

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in Azure DNS will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Azure DNS nameserver configuration inside the accordion above */}

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Add the record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field. For example, paste only `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`.
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Enter the **Value** from Lettr into the **CNAME** field.
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-1.png" alt="CNAME record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of CNAME record in Azure DNS */}

<Info>
  Azure DNS automatically appends your zone name to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Add the record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field. For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Enter the **Value** from Lettr into the text field.
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-2.png" alt="DKIM TXT record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DKIM TXT record in Azure DNS */}

<Info>
  DKIM values are long strings. After saving, re-open the record set to confirm the full value was stored correctly. If it
  appears truncated, delete and re-add the record.
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Add the record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field. For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Enter the **Value** from Lettr into the text field.
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-3.png" alt="DMARC TXT record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DMARC TXT record in Azure DNS */}

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-new.png" alt="Creating a new inbound domain in Lettr" />

Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-list.png" alt="Inbound domain listed in Lettr Inbound Domains list" />

This will display the MX records that need to be configured.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-config.png" alt="MX record configuration displayed in Lettr for inbound domain" />

### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Add each MX record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field. For example, paste only `inbound`.
3. Set **Type** to **MX**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Click **Add row** and enter the **Priority** (e.g. `10`) and the MX **Exchange** value (e.g. `rx1.sparkpostmail.com`).
6. Add two more rows for `rx2.sparkpostmail.com` and `rx3.sparkpostmail.com`, each with priority `10`.
7. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-1.png" alt="MX record values in Lettr for inbound domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of MX records in Azure DNS */}

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a domain or subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-verified.png" alt="Inbound domain verified successfully in Lettr" />

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<img src="/images/lettr-add-tracking.png" alt="Creating a new tracking domain in Lettr" />

Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.

<img src="/images/lettr-tracking-list.png" alt="Tracking domain listed in Lettr Tracking Domains list" />

This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.

<img src="/images/lettr-tracking-config.png" alt="CNAME records displayed in Lettr for tracking domain configuration" />

### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field.
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Enter the **Value** from Lettr into the **CNAME** field.
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-tracking-1.png" alt="SSL Certificate CNAME record values in Lettr for tracking domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of SSL Certificate CNAME record in Azure DNS */}

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field.
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Enter the **Value** from Lettr into the **CNAME** field.

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-new.png" alt="Creating a new storage domain in Lettr" />

Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-list.png" alt="Storage domain listed in Lettr Storage Domains list" />

This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-config.png" alt="TXT and CNAME records displayed in Lettr for storage domain configuration" />

### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field.
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Enter the **Value** from Lettr into the text field.
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-1.png" alt="Certificate Validation TXT record values in Lettr for storage domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Certificate Validation TXT record in Azure DNS */}

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field.
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Enter the **Value** from Lettr into the text field.
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-2.png" alt="Hostname Pre-validation TXT record values in Lettr for storage domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Hostname Pre-validation TXT record in Azure DNS */}

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Azure DNS:

1. Click **+ Record set** in your DNS zone.
2. Enter the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix) into the **Name** field.
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
5. Enter the **Value** from Lettr into the **CNAME** field.
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-3.png" alt="Domain Routing CNAME record values in Lettr for storage domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Domain Routing CNAME record in Azure DNS */}

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Using Azure CLI

You can also add records using the Azure CLI:

```bash
# Add CNAME record for subdomain
az network dns record-set cname set-record \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --zone-name example.com \
  --record-set-name mailing \
  --cname sparkpostmail.com

# Add TXT record for DKIM
az network dns record-set txt add-record \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --zone-name example.com \
  --record-set-name "scph0126._domainkey.mailing" \
  --value "v=DKIM1;k=rsa;h=sha256;p=MIGf..."

# Add MX records for inbound
az network dns record-set mx add-record \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --zone-name example.com \
  --record-set-name inbound \
  --exchange rx1.sparkpostmail.com \
  --preference 10
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission Errors">
    Ensure you have the **DNS Zone Contributor** role or equivalent permissions on the DNS zone resource in Azure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    Azure DNS typically propagates within minutes, but in some cases it can take longer. If verification fails after adding
    records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 30 minutes** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to Azure">
    If your records are saved in Azure DNS but not resolving, confirm that your domain registrar is pointing to Azure's
    nameservers. You can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include the four Azure nameservers shown in your DNS zone overview (e.g. `ns1-xx.azuredns.com`). If it
    shows a different provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong type when creating the record set:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record set in Azure, re-open it to confirm the full value was
    stored. If it appears truncated, delete the record and re-add it, pasting the full value carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after
    48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the
    output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
