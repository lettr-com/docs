description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on Gandi."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Gandi's DNS management. Gandi is a domain registrar and hosting provider that offers DNS hosting for domains managed through its [Gandi LiveDNS interface](https://www.gandi.net).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.


This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.


### Configure Gandi DNS

Log in to your [Gandi account](https://www.gandi.net) and navigate to your domain's **DNS** settings. If your domain uses Gandi LiveDNS, you can manage records directly in the LiveDNS interface.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Gandi DNS zone editor */}

<Info>
  Gandi requires trailing periods (`.`) on CNAME and MX target values. When pasting values from Lettr, ensure each target
  ends with a period (e.g. `sparkpostmail.com.`). If Lettr provides the value without a trailing period, add one manually.
</Info>

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through Gandi or your nameservers already point to Gandi, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using Gandi's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Gandi, you must first **update the nameservers**
    at your registrar to Gandi's nameservers shown in your domain configuration.

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in Gandi will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Gandi nameserver configuration inside the accordion above */}

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr, ensuring it ends with a trailing period (e.g. `sparkpostmail.com.`).
5. Leave **TTL** at the default or set to **10800**.
6. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-sending-1.png */}

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr, enclosed in double quotes (e.g. `"v=DKIM1; ..."`).
5. Leave **TTL** at the default or set to **10800**.
6. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-sending-2.png */}

<Info>
  Gandi requires TXT record values to be enclosed in double quotes. If the value from Lettr is not already quoted, wrap it
  in double quotes before saving.
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr, enclosed in double quotes (e.g. `"v=DMARC1;p=none;"`).
5. Leave **TTL** at the default or set to **10800**.
6. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-sending-3.png */}

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.


---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.


Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.


This will display the MX records that need to be configured.


### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
3. Set **Type** to **MX**.
4. Set **Value** to `10 rx1.sparkpostmail.com.` (priority followed by the MX target with a trailing period).
5. Add additional lines for `10 rx2.sparkpostmail.com.` and `10 rx3.sparkpostmail.com.`.
6. Leave **TTL** at the default or set to **10800**.
7. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-inbound-1.png */}

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a domain or subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.


---

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.


This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.


### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr, ensuring it ends with a trailing period.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-tracking-1.png */}

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr, ensuring it ends with a trailing period.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-tracking-2.png */}

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**


Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.


This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.


### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr, enclosed in double quotes.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-storage-1.png */}

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **TXT**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr, enclosed in double quotes.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-storage-2.png */}

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Gandi:

1. Click **Add a record** in the DNS zone editor.
2. Set **Name** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Type** to **CNAME**.
4. Set **Value** to the **Value** from Lettr, ensuring it ends with a trailing period.
5. Click **Save**.


{/* TODO: Add screenshot of gandi-storage-3.png */}

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing Trailing Period">
    Gandi requires trailing periods on CNAME and MX target values. If your records are not resolving, check that each CNAME
    and MX target ends with a period (e.g. `sparkpostmail.com.` not `sparkpostmail.com`). Edit the record and add the trailing
    period if it is missing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    Gandi DNS propagation can take several hours. If verification fails after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 2–3 hours** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [WhatsMyDNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net) or [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="TXT Values Not Quoted">
    Gandi requires TXT record values to be wrapped in double quotes. If your DKIM or DMARC records are not resolving, edit
    them and ensure the value is enclosed in double quotes (e.g. `"v=DMARC1;p=none;"`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong record type:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record, re-open it in the DNS zone editor to confirm the full
    value was stored. If it appears truncated, delete and re-add the record, pasting the full value carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after
    48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the
    output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
