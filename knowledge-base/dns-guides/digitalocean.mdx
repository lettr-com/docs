description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on DigitalOcean."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using DigitalOcean's DNS management. DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure provider that offers DNS hosting as part of its platform, managed through the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<img src="/images/lettr-create-sending-domain.png" alt="Create Sending Domain button in Lettr" />

<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.

<img src="/images/lettr-sending-list.png" alt="Sending domain listed in Lettr Sending Domains list" />

This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.

### Configure DigitalOcean DNS

Log in to the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com) and navigate to **Networking** → **Domains**. Select the domain you want to configure.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DigitalOcean Domains page */}

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through DigitalOcean or your nameservers already point to DigitalOcean, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using DigitalOcean's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on DigitalOcean, you must first add the domain to DigitalOcean
    and then **update the nameservers** at your registrar to DigitalOcean's nameservers.

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in DigitalOcean will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DigitalOcean nameserver configuration inside the accordion above */}

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to DigitalOcean:

1. Click **Create new record** in the domain's DNS settings.
2. Select **CNAME** from the record type dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in DigitalOcean (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** (target) field in DigitalOcean.
5. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-1.png" alt="CNAME record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of CNAME record in DigitalOcean DNS */}

<Info>
  DigitalOcean automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to DigitalOcean:

1. Click **Create new record** in the domain's DNS settings.
2. Select **TXT** from the record type dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in DigitalOcean (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Data** field in DigitalOcean.
5. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-2.png" alt="DKIM TXT record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DKIM TXT record in DigitalOcean DNS */}

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to DigitalOcean:

1. Click **Create new record** in the domain's DNS settings.
2. Select **TXT** from the record type dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in DigitalOcean (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Data** field in DigitalOcean.
5. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-mailing-3.png" alt="DMARC TXT record Hostname and Value in Lettr" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of DMARC TXT record in DigitalOcean DNS */}

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-new.png" alt="Creating a new inbound domain in Lettr" />

Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-list.png" alt="Inbound domain listed in Lettr Inbound Domains list" />

This will display the MX records that need to be configured.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-config.png" alt="MX record configuration displayed in Lettr for inbound domain" />

### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to DigitalOcean:

1. Click **Create new record** in the domain's DNS settings.
2. Select **MX** from the record type dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field in DigitalOcean (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
4. Copy the first **Required MX Record** value (without the priority number) from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** (target) field in DigitalOcean.
5. Set **Priority** to `10`.
6. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
7. Click **Save**.
8. Repeat this process for the second (`rx2.sparkpostmail.com`) and third (`rx3.sparkpostmail.com`) MX records.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-1.png" alt="MX record values in Lettr for inbound domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of MX records in DigitalOcean DNS */}

<Warning>
  Adding MX records to a domain or subdomain will route all incoming email for that address to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

<img src="/images/lettr-inbound-verified.png" alt="Inbound domain verified successfully in Lettr" />

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<img src="/images/lettr-add-tracking.png" alt="Creating a new tracking domain in Lettr" />

Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.

<img src="/images/lettr-tracking-list.png" alt="Tracking domain listed in Lettr Tracking Domains list" />

This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.

<img src="/images/lettr-tracking-config.png" alt="CNAME records displayed in Lettr for tracking domain configuration" />

### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in DigitalOcean:

1. Click **Create new record** in the domain's DNS settings.
2. Select **CNAME** from the record type dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** (target) field.
5. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-tracking-1.png" alt="SSL Certificate CNAME record values in Lettr for tracking domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of SSL Certificate CNAME record in DigitalOcean DNS */}

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-new.png" alt="Creating a new storage domain in Lettr" />

Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-list.png" alt="Storage domain listed in Lettr Storage Domains list" />

This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-config.png" alt="TXT and CNAME records displayed in Lettr for storage domain configuration" />

### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in DigitalOcean:

1. Click **Create new record** in the domain's DNS settings.
2. Select **TXT** from the record type dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Data** field.
5. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-1.png" alt="Certificate Validation TXT record values in Lettr for storage domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Certificate Validation TXT record in DigitalOcean DNS */}

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in DigitalOcean:

1. Click **Create new record** in the domain's DNS settings.
2. Select **TXT** from the record type dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Data** field.
5. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-2.png" alt="Hostname Pre-validation TXT record values in Lettr for storage domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Hostname Pre-validation TXT record in DigitalOcean DNS */}

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in DigitalOcean:

1. Click **Create new record** in the domain's DNS settings.
2. Select **CNAME** from the record type dropdown.
3. Copy the **Hostname** from Lettr and paste it into the **Name** field (without your domain suffix).
4. Copy the **Value** from Lettr and paste it into the **Hostname** (target) field.
5. Set **TTL** to **3600** (or leave at the default).
6. Click **Save**.

<img src="/images/lettr-storage-3.png" alt="Domain Routing CNAME record values in Lettr for storage domain" />

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Domain Routing CNAME record in DigitalOcean DNS */}

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    DNS propagation on DigitalOcean typically takes 5–30 minutes, but can occasionally take longer. If verification fails
    after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 30 minutes** before your first verification attempt.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CNAME at Root Domain Not Supported">
    DigitalOcean does not allow CNAME records at the root of a domain (e.g. `company.com`). You must use a subdomain for
    your sending domain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`). This is also a DNS protocol limitation — CNAME records cannot coexist
    with other record types at the same name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong type in the record type dropdown:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record, click **Edit** to confirm the full value was stored. If
    it appears truncated, delete the record and re-add it, pasting the full value carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to DigitalOcean">
    If your records are saved in DigitalOcean but not resolving, confirm that your domain registrar is pointing to
    DigitalOcean's nameservers. You can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include DigitalOcean nameservers (e.g. `ns1.digitalocean.com`, `ns2.digitalocean.com`,
    `ns3.digitalocean.com`). If it shows a different provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after
    48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the
    output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
