description: "Step-by-step guide to configuring DNS records for Lettr on Hostinger."
---

This guide walks you through adding the required DNS records for Lettr using Hostinger's DNS management. Hostinger is a web hosting provider that offers DNS hosting for domains managed through its [hPanel dashboard](https://hpanel.hostinger.com).

You will configure a **sending domain** (CNAME, DKIM TXT, and DMARC TXT records) and, optionally, an **inbound domain** (MX records), **tracking domain** (two CNAME records), and **storage domain** (CNAME and two TXT records).

---

## Sending Domain Setup

A sending domain authenticates your outgoing emails with DKIM and DMARC, ensuring they are delivered reliably and not marked as spam. This requires a CNAME record for domain verification, a TXT record for DKIM signing, and a TXT record for DMARC policy.

To create a sending domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Sending Domains**
3. Click **Create Sending Domain**
4. Enter your desired sending subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

<Tip>
  Use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) instead of the root domain (`company.com`). A subdomain provides proper
  reputation segmentation and is required if you also plan to receive emails with Lettr.
</Tip>

Click your new domain in the Sending Domains list.

This will display a list of DNS records that need to be configured. Keep this page open — you will need these values soon.

### Configure Hostinger DNS

Log in to your [Hostinger hPanel](https://hpanel.hostinger.com) and navigate to **Domains** → **Domain Portfolio**. Click **Manage** next to the domain you want to configure, then open the **DNS / Nameservers** tab and select **DNS records**.

<Tip>
  If your domain was purchased through Hostinger or your nameservers already point to Hostinger, skip nameserver
  configuration entirely. Your domain is already using Hostinger's nameservers by default — proceed directly to adding the
  DNS records below.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain registered with a different registrar?">
    If you registered your domain elsewhere but want to manage DNS on Hostinger, you must first **update the nameservers**
    at your registrar to Hostinger's nameservers. Your assigned nameservers are shown in your hPanel under **Websites** →
    **Dashboard** → **Plan Details**. They typically follow the format `ns1.dns-parking.com` and `ns2.dns-parking.com`,
    but the exact values vary by account — always use what your panel shows.

    <Warning>Until the nameservers are updated, any records you add in Hostinger will not resolve.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Add CNAME Record

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership with Lettr's email infrastructure.

Copy the CNAME values from Lettr to Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **CNAME** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `mailing`.
3. Set **Target (Points to)** to the **Value** from Lettr.
4. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `mailing`, not `mailing.company.com`). If you paste the full hostname, the resulting record will resolve as
  `mailing.company.com.company.com`, which will fail verification.
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DKIM)

The DKIM record adds a cryptographic signature to your outgoing emails, allowing recipients to verify they were sent by an authorized sender.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **TXT** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`.
3. Set **TXT Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
4. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, not `scph0126._domainkey.mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add TXT Record (DMARC)

The DMARC record tells receiving mail servers how to handle emails that fail authentication checks, protecting your domain from spoofing.

Copy the TXT values from Lettr to Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **TXT** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `_dmarc.mailing`.
3. Set **TXT Value** to the **Value** from Lettr (e.g. `v=DMARC1;p=none;`).
4. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `_dmarc.mailing`, not `_dmarc.mailing.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Sending Domain

After adding all three DNS records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

---

## Inbound Domain Setup

An inbound domain allows Lettr to receive emails on your behalf. This requires three MX records that direct incoming mail to Lettr's mail servers.

### Add Inbound Domain to Lettr

To create an Inbound domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Inbound Domains**
3. Click **Create Inbound Domain**
4. Enter your desired inbound subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**.

Click on your new domain in the Inbound Domains list.

This will display the MX records that need to be configured.

### Add MX Records

MX records tell other mail servers where to deliver emails addressed to your domain.

Copy the MX values from Lettr to Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **MX** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** value from Lettr (without your domain suffix). For example, paste only `inbound`.
3. Set **Mail server (Points to)** to `rx1.sparkpostmail.com`.
4. Set **Priority** to `10`.
5. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
6. Click **Add Record**.
7. Repeat this process for the second (`rx2.sparkpostmail.com`) and third (`rx3.sparkpostmail.com`) MX records, each with priority `10`.

<Info>
  Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `inbound`, not `inbound.company.com`).
</Info>

<Warning>
  All emails sent to the domain or subdomain where MX records are configured will be routed to Lettr. Use a dedicated
  subdomain (e.g. `inbound.company.com`) to avoid affecting your primary email.
</Warning>

### Verify Your Inbound Domain

After adding all three MX records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**. DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, though it typically completes within a few minutes.

## Tracking Domain Setup

A tracking domain allows Lettr to track email opens and link clicks using your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr tracking domain. This requires two CNAME records: one for the SSL certificate and one for routing tracking traffic to Lettr's infrastructure.

### Add Tracking Domain to Lettr

To create a Tracking domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Tracking Domains**
3. Click **Create Tracking Domain**
4. Enter your desired tracking subdomain (e.g. `tracking.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Tracking Domains list.

This will display the CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add SSL Certificate CNAME Record

The SSL Certificate CNAME record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom tracking domain, enabling secure HTTPS connections for tracked links.

Add the record in Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **CNAME** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Target (Points to)** to the **Value** from Lettr.
4. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `tracking`, not `tracking.company.com`).
</Info>

### Add Traffic CNAME Record

The Traffic CNAME record routes click and open tracking requests from your custom domain to Lettr's tracking servers.

Add the record in Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **CNAME** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Target (Points to)** to the **Value** from Lettr.
4. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `tracking`, not `tracking.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Tracking Domain

After adding both CNAME records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

---

## Storage Domain Setup

A storage domain lets you serve email assets (images, attachments) from your own custom domain instead of the default Lettr storage URL. This requires two TXT records for certificate validation and ownership verification, and a CNAME record for routing asset requests to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

### Add Storage Domain to Lettr

To create a Storage domain in Lettr:
1. Select **Domains** in the navigation panel
2. Select **Storage Domains**
3. Click **Create Storage Domain**
4. Enter your desired storage subdomain (e.g. `assets.company.com`)
5. Click **Create Domain**

Click on your new domain in the Storage Domains list.

This will display the TXT and CNAME records that need to be configured.

### Add TXT Record (Certificate Validation)

The Certificate Validation TXT record provisions an SSL certificate for your custom storage domain, enabling secure HTTPS delivery of email assets.

Add the record in Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **TXT** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **TXT Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
4. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion, just as with the CNAME record above.</Info>

### Add TXT Record (Hostname Pre-validation)

The Hostname Pre-validation TXT record verifies ownership of the storage domain before Lettr provisions a custom hostname for it.

Add the record in Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **TXT** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **TXT Value** to the **Value** from Lettr.
4. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion, just as with the CNAME record above.</Info>

### Add CNAME Record (Domain Routing)

The Domain Routing CNAME record routes asset requests from your custom domain to Lettr's storage infrastructure.

Add the record in Hostinger:

1. In the **DNS records** tab, select **CNAME** from the **Type** dropdown.
2. Set **Name (Host)** to the **Hostname** from Lettr (without your domain suffix).
3. Set **Target (Points to)** to the **Value** from Lettr.
4. Leave **TTL** at the default (14400).
5. Click **Add Record**.

<Info>
  Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the record name. Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g.
  `assets`, not `assets.company.com`).
</Info>

### Verify Your Storage Domain

After adding all three records, go back to Lettr and click **Verify DNS Records**.

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Suffix Not Omitted">
    Hostinger automatically appends your domain to the **Name (Host)** field. If you paste the full hostname (e.g.
    `mailing.company.com`), the resulting record will resolve as `mailing.company.com.company.com`, which will fail
    verification.

    Always paste only the subdomain portion (e.g. `mailing`, `scph0126._domainkey.mailing`, `_dmarc.mailing`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Records Not Propagating">
    Hostinger DNS changes are typically applied within minutes, but external resolvers may take longer to pick up the
    changes. If verification fails after adding records, check the following:

    - **Wait at least 30 minutes** before your first verification attempt. Most records propagate within 1–2 hours.
    - **Confirm the records exist** using command-line tools:

    ```bash
    # Check CNAME record
    dig CNAME mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DKIM record
    dig TXT scph0126._domainkey.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.mailing.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check MX records (inbound)
    dig MX inbound.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check tracking domain CNAME
    dig CNAME track.yourdomain.com +short

    # Check storage domain CNAME
    dig CNAME assets.yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    - **Use a web tool** like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation across multiple DNS servers worldwide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nameservers Not Pointing to Hostinger">
    If your records are saved in Hostinger but not resolving, confirm that your domain registrar is pointing to
    Hostinger's nameservers. You can check this with:

    ```bash
    dig NS yourdomain.com +short
    ```

    The output should include your assigned Hostinger nameservers (e.g. `ns1.dns-parking.com`, `ns2.dns-parking.com`).
    Your exact nameservers are shown in hPanel under **Websites** → **Dashboard** → **Plan Details**. If the output shows
    a different provider's nameservers, update them at your domain registrar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CNAME at Root Domain Not Supported">
    Standard CNAME records cannot be used at the root of a domain (e.g. `company.com`). If you enter `@` as the name for
    a CNAME record, Hostinger will silently convert it to an ALIAS record on save — it will not appear as CNAME in the
    list. Always use a subdomain (e.g. `mailing.company.com`) for your sending, tracking, and storage domains.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong Record Type">
    A common mistake is selecting the wrong type from the **Type** dropdown in Hostinger's DNS records tab:

    | Record | Correct Type |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Sending verification | CNAME |
    | DKIM | TXT |
    | DMARC | TXT |
    | Inbound mail | MX |
    | Tracking SSL certificate | CNAME |
    | Tracking traffic | CNAME |
    | Storage certificate validation | TXT |
    | Storage hostname pre-validation | TXT |
    | Storage domain routing | CNAME |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CNAME Conflict">
    Remove any existing A or CNAME records for the same hostname before adding new CNAME records. Hostinger does not
    automatically remove conflicting records. Duplicate or conflicting records on the same hostname will cause
    verification failures.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DKIM Value Truncated">
    The DKIM TXT value is a long string. After saving the record, re-open the DNS records tab and locate the record to
    confirm the full value is displayed in the **TXT Value** column. If it appears truncated, delete the record and
    re-add it, pasting the full value carefully into the **TXT Value** field.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Contact Support">
    If your DNS records are correctly configured (confirmed with `dig` or dnschecker.org) and verification still fails after
    48 hours, contact Lettr support at **support@lettr.com** or through the in-app chat. Include your domain name and the
    output of the `dig` commands above.
  </Accordion>
