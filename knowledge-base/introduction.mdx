## Quick Answers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why isn't my email being delivered?">
    Check your domain verification status, ensure the recipient isn't suppressed, and verify you're not hitting rate limits. See [Delivery Issues](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/delivery-issues) for detailed troubleshooting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are my emails going to spam?">
    Common causes include missing authentication (DKIM, DMARC), poor sender reputation, spam trigger words in content, or missing unsubscribe links. See [Emails Landing in Spam](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/spam-placement) for a step-by-step diagnosis guide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I verify my domain?">
    Add the DNS records shown in your dashboard (CNAME, DKIM, DMARC), wait for propagation, then click Verify. See [Domains](/learn/domains/introduction) for details or [Domain Verification](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/domain-verification) if you're having issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the API rate limits?">
    Standard: 300 requests per 5 minutes. High-volume: 2,000 requests per 5 minutes. See [Rate Limits](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/rate-limits) for details and handling strategies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need an unsubscribe link?">
    Marketing and promotional emails require an unsubscribe link by law (CAN-SPAM, GDPR). Since February 2024, Google and Yahoo also require one-click unsubscribe for bulk senders. See [Unsubscribe Best Practices](/knowledge-base/compliance/unsubscribe-best-practices).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I send from a subdomain or root domain?">
    For most senders, a subdomain (like `mail.yourdomain.com`) is recommended. It provides reputation isolation so problems with one email type don't affect others. See [Subdomain vs Root Domain](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/subdomain-vs-root).
