## Understanding Gmail's Tab System

Gmail sorts incoming email into tabs: **Primary**, **Promotions**, **Social**, **Updates**, and **Forums**. Tab placement is not the same as spam — emails in the Promotions tab are delivered successfully, but they get less visibility.

### What Determines Tab Placement

Gmail uses machine learning to classify messages. The main signals are:

| Signal | Primary | Promotions |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Sender relationship** | Frequent 1:1 conversations | Bulk or automated sends |
| **Content style** | Plain text, conversational tone | HTML-heavy, images, CTAs |
| **Unsubscribe header** | Absent (transactional) | Present (marketing) |
| **Engagement history** | Recipient regularly opens and replies | Recipient rarely interacts |
| **Links and images** | Few or none | Multiple links, large images |

### Improving Primary Tab Placement

For transactional emails that are landing in Promotions:

- **Simplify the HTML** — use minimal styling, fewer images, and avoid marketing-style layouts for receipts, alerts, and notifications.
- **Remove promotional elements** — banners, upsells, social media links, and footer marketing content push messages toward Promotions.
- **Use a plain From name** — a personal name (e.g., "Jane from Acme") performs better than a brand name for Primary placement.
- **Send from a separate subdomain** — isolate transactional email on a subdomain like `notify.yourdomain.com` so its reputation isn't affected by marketing sends.

<Tip>
  Tab placement is per-user. If a recipient manually drags your email from Promotions to Primary, Gmail learns to place future messages from you in Primary for that user.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Do not try to trick Gmail's tab classifier by stripping unsubscribe headers from marketing email. This violates [Google & Yahoo Requirements](/knowledge-base/compliance/google-yahoo-requirements) and will damage your reputation.
</Warning>

## Setting Up Google Postmaster Tools

Google Postmaster Tools (GPT) is the most important diagnostic tool for Gmail delivery. It shows domain reputation, spam rate, authentication status, and delivery errors — data that is not available anywhere else.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Google Postmaster Tools">
    Visit [postmaster.google.com](https://postmaster.google.com/) and sign in with a Google account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your sending domain">
    Click the **+** button and enter your sending domain (e.g., `mail.yourdomain.com`). Use the exact domain you send from in Lettr, including the subdomain if applicable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify domain ownership">
    Google provides a TXT record to add to your DNS. Add it at your DNS provider:

    ```
    google-site-verification=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

    Click **Verify** once the record is published. Propagation usually takes a few minutes but can take up to 48 hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for data">
    Data appears after you send a sufficient volume to Gmail addresses (typically 100+ messages per day). Dashboards populate within 24–48 hours of reaching this threshold.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Dashboards

| Dashboard | What It Shows | What to Watch For |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Spam Rate** | Percentage of emails marked as spam by recipients | Keep below 0.1%. Action required above 0.3%. |
| **Domain Reputation** | Overall trust level: High, Medium, Low, Bad | Low or Bad causes most email to go to spam |
| **IP Reputation** | Trust level of sending IP addresses | Relevant if using dedicated IPs |
| **Authentication** | DKIM, SPF, and DMARC pass rates | Should be 100%. Any failures need investigation. |
| **Delivery Errors** | Temporary and permanent rejection reasons | Identifies specific blocks and rate limits |

## Common Gmail Blocks and Errors

### Temporary Blocks (4xx Errors)

Gmail throttles senders who exceed its internal rate limits or whose reputation dips. These are temporary and resolve automatically, but they signal a problem.

```
421-4.7.28 Our system has detected an unusual rate of unsolicited mail
originating from your IP address.
```

**Causes and fixes:**

- **Volume spike** — you sent significantly more email than usual. Reduce volume and ramp up gradually. See [IP and Domain Warm-Up](/knowledge-base/best-practices/ip-domain-warmup).
- **High spam complaint rate** — check Google Postmaster Tools. Reduce complaints by improving list quality and making unsubscribe easy.
- **Sending to many invalid addresses** — clean your list. See [List Hygiene](/knowledge-base/best-practices/list-hygiene).

<Note>
  Lettr automatically handles 4xx retries. Temporary blocks typically resolve within a few hours. If they persist beyond 24 hours, review your sending practices.
</Note>

### Permanent Blocks (5xx Errors)

Permanent rejections mean Gmail refused the message entirely.

```
550-5.7.1 Our system has detected that this message is likely
unsolicited mail. To reduce the amount of spam sent to Gmail,
this message has been blocked.
```

| Error Code | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `550-5.7.1` | Message blocked as spam | Review content, check authentication, verify reputation |
| `550-5.7.26` | DMARC authentication failed | Fix DMARC alignment — ensure your From domain matches your DKIM signing domain |
| `550-5.7.27` | SPF record missing or invalid | Add or correct your SPF record |
| `550-5.1.1` | Recipient address doesn't exist | Remove the address from your list |
| `421-4.7.28` | Rate limited due to reputation | Reduce volume, improve engagement metrics |

### DMARC Enforcement

Gmail strictly enforces DMARC policies. If your domain publishes `p=reject` or `p=quarantine` and authentication fails, Gmail will reject or spam-folder the message with no exceptions.

Verify your DMARC alignment:

```bash
# Check your DMARC record
dig TXT _dmarc.yourdomain.com +short

# Expected output (example)
"v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com; adkim=r; aspf=r"
```

Ensure the domain in your `From` address matches the domain used for DKIM signing in Lettr. Check this on the [Domains page](https://app.lettr.com/domains).

## Gmail and Engagement Signals

Gmail weighs recipient engagement more heavily than most providers. Low engagement leads to progressively worse placement over time.

### Signals Gmail Tracks

- **Opens** — recipients who regularly open your emails signal trust
- **Replies** — direct replies are the strongest positive signal
- **Moves to spam** — the strongest negative signal
- **Moves from spam to inbox** — a strong positive signal
- **Deletes without opening** — a weak negative signal
- **Stars and labels** — positive engagement signals

### Improving Engagement

1. **Segment by engagement** — send more frequently to engaged recipients and less to inactive ones.
2. **Re-engagement campaigns** — before removing inactive subscribers, send a targeted re-engagement email. If they don't respond, suppress them.
3. **Send at the right time** — use Lettr's analytics to identify when your recipients are most active.
4. **Relevant content** — personalize emails based on recipient behavior and preferences. See [Personalization and Dynamic Content](/knowledge-base/best-practices/personalization-dynamic-content).

## Diagnosing Gmail Issues Checklist

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Google Postmaster Tools first">
    Most Gmail delivery problems are visible in Postmaster Tools. Check domain reputation, spam rate, and authentication dashboards before investigating anything else.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify authentication passes">
    Send a test email to a Gmail account. Open the message, click the three-dot menu, and select **Show original**. Confirm `dkim=pass`, `spf=pass`, and `dmarc=pass` all appear in the Authentication-Results header.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check for blocklisting">
    Search your sending domain and IPs on [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx). Being listed on Spamhaus, SORBS, or other major blocklists will cause Gmail to reject or spam-folder your messages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review recent content changes">
    If delivery degraded after a content change, compare the new email against the previous version. Look for newly added URL shorteners, excessive images, or spam trigger words.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check complaint rate trend">
    A gradual increase in spam complaints — even if still below 0.3% — will eventually cause reputation damage. Address the trend early.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Confirm one-click unsubscribe is working">
    Gmail requires a functional `List-Unsubscribe` header with one-click support for bulk senders. Lettr adds this automatically, but verify it hasn't been overridden via custom headers in the API.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
