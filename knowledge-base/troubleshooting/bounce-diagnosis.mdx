# Bounce Diagnosis

When an email bounces, Lettr provides structured data about the failure — including a bounce type, category, SMTP response code, and human-readable message. This guide explains how to read that data and respond appropriately.

---

## Hard vs Soft Bounces

Lettr classifies every bounce as either **hard** or **soft**. The distinction determines how the platform handles the failure automatically and what action you should take.

### Hard Bounces

A hard bounce is a permanent delivery failure. The recipient's mail server has definitively rejected the email, and retrying will not succeed. Lettr automatically suppresses hard-bounced addresses so you never send to them again.

**Examples:** The email address does not exist, the domain has no mail server, or the recipient has permanently blocked your sender.

### Soft Bounces

A soft bounce is a temporary delivery failure. The email may be deliverable if retried later. Lettr automatically retries soft bounces up to 3 times with exponential backoff before giving up.

**Examples:** The recipient's mailbox is full, the server is temporarily unavailable, or the message was rate-limited.

<Note>
  If a soft bounce continues to fail after all retry attempts, Lettr records a final bounce event. Addresses that repeatedly soft bounce over time may eventually be suppressed.
</Note>

---

## Bounce Categories Reference

Every bounce event includes a `bounceCategory` that describes the specific reason for the failure. Use this table to determine the correct response for each category.

| Category | Type | Description | Recommended Action |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `invalid_address` | Hard | The email address does not exist or is permanently invalid | Remove from your list immediately |
| `domain_not_found` | Hard | The domain does not exist or has no configured mail server | Remove from your list immediately |
| `mailbox_full` | Soft | The recipient's mailbox has exceeded its storage quota | Wait for automatic retry; no immediate action needed |
| `blocked` | Hard | The recipient or their mail server has blocked delivery from your sender | Investigate the cause and remove the address |
| `spam_related` | Hard | The message was rejected by spam filters or content policies | Review your email content and sender reputation |
| `policy_related` | Hard | The receiving server rejected the message due to administrative policy | Contact the recipient through another channel if needed |
| `server_error` | Soft | A temporary server-side issue prevented delivery | Wait for automatic retry; no immediate action needed |
| `protocol_error` | Soft | A technical problem occurred during the SMTP transaction | Wait for automatic retry; no immediate action needed |
| `unknown` | Varies | The bounce could not be classified into a known category | Review the `bounceCode` and `message` fields manually |

---

## SMTP Response Code Reference

The `bounceCode` field in bounce events contains the SMTP response code returned by the recipient's mail server. These codes provide additional detail beyond the bounce category.

### Temporary Failures (4xx)

These codes indicate a temporary issue. Lettr automatically retries delivery for these responses.

| Code | Meaning | Typical Cause |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `421` | Server temporarily unavailable | The receiving server is down, overloaded, or restarting |
| `450` | Mailbox unavailable (busy) | The mailbox exists but is temporarily locked or in use |
| `452` | Insufficient storage | The recipient's mailbox is full or the server is out of disk space |

### Permanent Failures (5xx)

These codes indicate a permanent failure. The address should be removed from your list or the issue investigated.

| Code | Meaning | Typical Cause |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `550 5.1.1` | User unknown / mailbox not found | The email address does not exist on the receiving server |
| `550 5.1.2` | Bad destination domain | The domain exists but is not configured to receive email |
| `550 5.7.1` | Message rejected (policy/spam) | The message was blocked due to content filtering or sender policy |
| `551` | User not local | The recipient is not hosted on that server and forwarding was refused |
| `552` | Message too large | The email exceeded the recipient server's size limit |
| `553` | Invalid mailbox name | The email address format is syntactically invalid |
| `554` | Transaction failed | A general rejection — check the full `message` field for details |

<Warning>
  SMTP response codes alone do not tell the full story. Always read the `message` field in the bounce event for the specific reason provided by the receiving server.
</Warning>

## Reading Bounce Webhook Events

The most reliable way to monitor bounces is through webhooks. When an email bounces, Lettr sends an `email.bounced` event to your configured webhook endpoint.

### Event Payload

```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "type": "email.bounced",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z",
  "data": {
    "emailId": "email_123",
    "requestId": "req_456",
    "to": "invalid@nonexistent.com",
    "bounceType": "hard",
    "bounceCategory": "invalid_address",
    "bounceCode": "550",
    "message": "550 5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist",
    "bouncedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z"
  }
}
```

### Webhook Handler

This handler processes bounce events, updates your subscriber records, and alerts your team when reputation-threatening bounces occur:

```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/lettr', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  if (event.type === 'email.bounced') {
    const { to, bounceType, bounceCategory, bounceCode, message } = event.data;

    // Log every bounce for analysis
    await logBounce({
      email: to,
      type: bounceType,
      category: bounceCategory,
      code: bounceCode,
      message: message,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });

    if (bounceType === 'hard') {
      // Mark the subscriber as bounced in your database
      await db.subscribers.update({
        where: { email: to },
        data: {
          status: 'bounced',
          bounceCategory: bounceCategory,
          lastBounceAt: new Date()
        }
      });

      // Alert the team for spam or block bounces
      if (bounceCategory === 'spam_related' || bounceCategory === 'blocked') {
        await notifyTeam({
          type: 'reputation_concern',
          email: to,
          reason: message
        });
      }
    }

    if (bounceType === 'soft') {
      // Track soft bounces — suppress after repeated failures
      await db.subscribers.update({
        where: { email: to },
        data: {
          softBounceCount: { increment: 1 },
          lastSoftBounceAt: new Date()
        }
      });
    }
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

## Out-of-Band Bounces

Some bounces arrive asynchronously, well after the initial delivery attempt appeared to succeed. These are called out-of-band (OOB) bounces. They occur when the receiving server initially accepts the message but later discovers it cannot be delivered — for example, when a forwarding address turns out to be invalid.

Lettr sends these as `email.out_of_band` events:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_oob789",
  "type": "email.out_of_band",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "emailId": "email_123",
    "requestId": "req_456",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "reason": "552 5.2.2 Mailbox full",
    "bouncedAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Handle out-of-band bounces the same way you handle regular bounces. Update your subscriber records and suppress the address if the failure is permanent:

```javascript
if (event.type === 'email.out_of_band') {
  const { to, reason } = event.data;

  await logBounce({
    email: to,
    type: 'out_of_band',
    message: reason,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });

  // Treat as a hard bounce — update your records
  await db.subscribers.update({
    where: { email: to },
    data: {
      status: 'bounced',
      lastBounceAt: new Date()
    }
  });
}
```

## Deferred Emails

A deferred email is not a bounce — it is a temporary delay. The receiving server has asked Lettr to try again later, usually because of rate limiting or temporary unavailability. Lettr tracks these as `email.deferred` events.

```json
{
  "id": "evt_jkl012",
  "type": "email.deferred",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z",
  "data": {
    "emailId": "email_123",
    "requestId": "req_456",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "reason": "421 Server temporarily unavailable",
    "retryCount": 1,
    "nextRetryAt": "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z",
    "deferredAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z"
  }
}
```

Lettr handles retries automatically with exponential backoff. You do not need to take action on individual deferral events.

**When to investigate deferrals:**

- A large number of emails to the same domain are being deferred — this may indicate that the receiving server is throttling you due to reputation concerns or volume limits.
- Emails to a specific recipient are deferred repeatedly across multiple sends — the receiving server may have a persistent issue.
- Your overall deferral rate spikes suddenly — check whether you recently increased sending volume or changed your content.

## Reducing Your Bounce Rate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Validate email addresses at collection">
    Check for valid syntax, common typos (e.g., `gmial.com`), and disposable email providers at the point of signup. Catching invalid addresses before they enter your list prevents bounces entirely.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use double opt-in">
    Require new subscribers to confirm their email address by clicking a link in a verification email. This ensures the address is real, reachable, and owned by the person who signed up.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle bounces in real time">
    Set up webhook handlers to process `email.bounced` and `email.out_of_band` events as they arrive. Remove hard-bounced addresses from your sending lists immediately rather than waiting for a batch cleanup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clean inactive addresses">
    Remove subscribers who have not opened or clicked any email in the past 6 to 12 months. Inactive addresses are more likely to become invalid over time as people abandon mailboxes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor your bounce rate continuously">
    Track your bounce rate in the Lettr dashboard after every send. If you notice an upward trend, investigate immediately rather than waiting for it to reach critical levels.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Bounce Rate Guidelines

Use these thresholds to assess the health of your sending practices:

| Bounce Rate | Status | What to Do |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Below 2% | Healthy | Your list hygiene is good. Continue current practices and monitor regularly. |
| 2% to 5% | Warning | Review your list for stale or unvalidated addresses. Implement double opt-in if you haven't already. Check recent list imports for quality issues. |
| Above 5% | Critical | Stop sending to unverified segments immediately. Clean your entire list by removing unengaged and invalid addresses. Investigate the source of bad addresses before resuming normal volume. |

<Warning>
  ISPs closely monitor bounce rates. A bounce rate consistently above 5% can result in your domain being throttled or blocked entirely. Address bounce rate problems before they escalate.
</Warning>
