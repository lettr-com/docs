When emails are not reaching your recipients, work through the steps below to identify and fix the issue.

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your domain status">
    Open the [Domains page](https://app.lettr.com/domains) in the Lettr dashboard. Your sending domain must show a status of **approved** and all DNS records must be **valid**. If anything shows `pending`, `unverified`, or `invalid`, resolve that first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the suppression list">
    Navigate to **Suppressions** in the dashboard and search for the recipient address. If the address appears on the list, it was suppressed due to a previous bounce or complaint and Lettr will not attempt delivery.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the email status">
    Go to **Emails** in the dashboard and locate the specific message. The status and any error details will tell you whether the email was accepted, bounced, or failed to send.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review bounce messages">
    If the email bounced, expand the event details in the dashboard to see the SMTP response code and message returned by the recipient server. These codes are explained further below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Not Verified">
    Lettr requires a verified sending domain before it will transmit any email. If your domain status is `pending` or DNS records show `unverified` / `invalid`, emails will fail with an `unconfigured_domain` or `invalid_domain` error.

    **To fix this:**

    1. Open the [Domains page](https://app.lettr.com/domains) in the dashboard.
    2. Click on the domain in question and review the required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
    3. Add or correct the records with your DNS provider.
    4. Click **Verify** in the dashboard, or trigger verification via the API:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/yourdomain.com/verify \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer lttr_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```

    You can also check the current domain status:

    ```bash
    curl https://app.lettr.com/api/domains \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer lttr_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```

    <Note>
      DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though most resolve within minutes.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recipient Suppressed">
    If a recipient previously hard-bounced or filed a spam complaint, Lettr automatically adds them to your suppression list. Any future sends to that address will be silently blocked.

    Suppressions are managed entirely through the dashboard — there is no API endpoint for suppressions. Navigate to **Suppressions**, search for the address, and remove it if you believe the issue has been resolved.

    <Warning>
      Repeatedly sending to addresses that have hard-bounced damages your sender reputation. Only remove a suppression if you have confirmed the mailbox is valid again.
    </Warning>

    See [Bounce Suppressions](/learn/suppressions/bounces) for more detail on how Lettr handles suppression rules.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Spam Filters Blocking">
    If your email is delivered but lands in the spam folder, the problem is not a Lettr delivery failure — it is a placement issue driven by content, authentication, or reputation.

    See [Troubleshooting Spam Placement](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/spam-placement) for a full guide on diagnosing and fixing spam folder placement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limited">
    If you are sending a high volume of emails in a short period, you may encounter rate limiting. Lettr returns an HTTP `429` status when the limit is reached.

    See [Rate Limits](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/rate-limits) for details on current limits and strategies for handling them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid From Address">
    The `from` address in your API request must use a domain that is verified in your Lettr account. If it does not, the API will reject the request.

    Possible error codes:

    | Error Code | HTTP Status | Meaning |
    |---|---|---|
    | `validation_error` | 422 | The `from` field is missing or malformed. |
    | `invalid_domain` | 400 | The domain in the `from` address is not recognized. |
    | `unconfigured_domain` | 400 | The domain exists but DNS is not properly configured. |

    Make sure your `from` address matches a domain with **approved** status and **valid** DNS in the dashboard.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Checking Email Status

The fastest way to check the status of a specific email is through the **Emails** section of the Lettr dashboard, where you can search by recipient, subject, or request ID.

You can also retrieve an email by its ID through the API:

```bash
curl https://app.lettr.com/api/emails/{id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lttr_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

The response will include the current delivery status and any error information associated with the message.

## Reading Bounce Messages

When a recipient server rejects an email, it returns an SMTP status code. Lettr surfaces these codes in the dashboard and through the `email.bounced` webhook event. Here are the most common codes and what to do about them:

| SMTP Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `550 5.1.1` | Mailbox does not exist. | Remove the address from your list. This is a hard bounce and the recipient is automatically suppressed. |
| `550 5.7.1` | Message rejected by policy (spam, authentication, or block). | Check your SPF/DKIM/DMARC records and review your email content for spam triggers. |
| `452 4.2.2` | Mailbox full. | This is a soft bounce. Lettr will retry automatically. If it persists, the recipient may have abandoned the mailbox. |
| `421 4.7.0` | Temporary rate limit from the recipient server. | No action needed. Lettr will retry delivery. If the problem persists across many recipients at the same domain, slow your sending rate. |

You can handle bounces programmatically using webhooks. The `email.bounced` event includes the bounce type and SMTP details:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/webhooks/lettr", (req, res) => {
  const { type, data } = req.body;

  if (type === "email.bounced") {
    console.log(`Bounce for ${data.to}`);
    console.log(`Type: ${data.bounceType}`);       // "hard" or "soft"
    console.log(`Category: ${data.bounceCategory}`);
    console.log(`Code: ${data.bounceCode}`);
    console.log(`Message: ${data.message}`);

    if (data.bounceType === "hard") {
      // Remove address from your mailing list
    }
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Testing Deliverability

Send a test email to an address you control to confirm your setup is working end to end:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lttr_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "test@yourdomain.com",
    "to": "you@example.com",
    "subject": "Lettr delivery test",
    "html": "<p>If you can read this, delivery is working.</p>"
  }'
```

Check your inbox (and spam folder). If the email arrives, your domain and authentication are configured correctly. If it does not, work through the diagnostic checklist above.

## Still Having Issues?

If you have worked through the steps above and emails are still not being delivered, contact the Lettr support team at **[support@lettr.com](mailto:support@lettr.com)**. Include the email request ID (returned in the API response when you sent the email) so the team can investigate quickly.
