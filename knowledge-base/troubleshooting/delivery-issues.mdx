# Troubleshooting Delivery Issues

Common issues and solutions when emails aren't being delivered.

## Quick Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Domain Status">
    Ensure your sending domain is verified with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Suppression List">
    The recipient may be suppressed due to previous bounces or complaints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Email Status">
    Look up the email in your dashboard to see its current status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Bounce Messages">
    Bounce messages often explain exactly why delivery failed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

### Domain Not Verified

**Symptoms:**
- Emails fail with "domain not verified" error
- Low deliverability to major providers

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Domains** in your dashboard
2. Check the verification status
3. Add missing DNS records
4. Click **Verify** to re-check

### Recipient Suppressed

**Symptoms:**
- Email status shows "suppressed"
- No bounce or error message

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check if address is suppressed
const check = await lettr.suppressions.check('user@example.com');

if (check.suppressed) {
  console.log(`Reason: ${check.type} - ${check.reason}`);
  
  // Remove suppression if appropriate
  // await lettr.suppressions.delete('user@example.com');
}
```

### Spam Filters Blocking

**Symptoms:**
- Emails delivered but go to spam
- Low open rates

**Solution:**
- Verify DMARC is properly configured
- Review email content for spam triggers
- Check your domain reputation
- Ensure proper unsubscribe links are included

### Rate Limited

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 429 errors
- Emails queued but not sending

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Implement backoff when rate limited
async function sendWithRetry(emailOptions, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await lettr.emails.send(emailOptions);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.code === 'rate_limit_exceeded') {
        const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000;
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, delay));
      } else {
        throw error;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Invalid From Address

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "From address not allowed"

**Solution:**
- Ensure the from address uses a verified domain
- Check that the domain is active (not deleted)

## Checking Email Status

Use the dashboard or API to check email status:

```javascript
const email = await lettr.emails.get('email_123');

console.log({
  status: email.status,
  deliveredAt: email.deliveredAt,
  bouncedAt: email.bouncedAt,
  bounceReason: email.bounceReason
});
```

## Reading Bounce Messages

Bounce messages provide specific failure reasons:

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 550 5.1.1 | User unknown | Remove from list |
| 550 5.7.1 | Blocked by policy | Check content/reputation |
| 452 4.2.2 | Mailbox full | Retry later |
| 421 4.7.0 | Rate limited | Slow down sending |

## Testing Deliverability

Send test emails to check your setup:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'test@yourdomain.com',
  to: ['your-personal-email@gmail.com'],
  subject: 'Deliverability Test',
  html: '<p>Testing deliverability</p>'
});
```

Check if it arrives in inbox vs spam.
