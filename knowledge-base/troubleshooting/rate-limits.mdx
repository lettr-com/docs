title: Rate Limits
description: "Understand and troubleshoot API rate limits, monthly quotas, and sending thresholds"
---

Lettr enforces rate limits to protect infrastructure stability and ensure consistent performance for all users. If you are receiving `429` errors or hitting monthly quotas, this guide covers how to identify the issue and adjust your sending approach.

---

## Rate Limit Overview

Lettr applies limits at the API request level, per authentication credential:

| Limit | Threshold | Window |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Standard API rate limit | 300 requests | 5 minutes |
| High-volume API rate limit | 2,000 requests | 5 minutes |
| Authentication failures | 5 failures | 5 minutes (triggers 15-minute block) |
| Recipients per request | 50 | Per request (combined to, cc, bcc) |

<Note>
  High-volume rate limits are available on Pro and Enterprise plans. Contact [sales@lettr.com](mailto:sales@lettr.com) to discuss your volume needs.
</Note>

---

## Rate Limit Response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns an HTTP `429` status code with the following response body:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests. Please retry after 60 seconds.",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

The `retry_after` field indicates how many seconds you should wait before making another request.

<Warning>
  If you continue sending requests after receiving a `429` response, the cooldown period may be extended. Always respect the `retry_after` value before retrying.
</Warning>

---

## Handling Rate Limits — Implementing Backoff

When your application receives a `429` response, it should pause and retry with exponential backoff. The following example reads the `retry_after` value from the response body and backs off accordingly:

```javascript
async function sendWithBackoff(url, payload, maxRetries = 5) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    });

    if (response.status === 429) {
      const body = await response.json();
      const retryAfter = body.retry_after || 60;
      const backoff = retryAfter * 1000 * Math.pow(2, attempt);

      console.log(`Rate limited. Retrying in ${backoff / 1000}s (attempt ${attempt + 1})`);
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, backoff));
      continue;
    }

    return await response.json();
  }

  throw new Error("Max retries exceeded");
}
```

```bash
# Send a request and check for 429 status
curl -s -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\n" \
  -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "you@example.com",
    "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
    "subject": "Hello",
    "html": "<p>Hi there</p>"
  }'
```

If the response status is `429`, parse the JSON body and wait for the number of seconds specified in `retry_after` before retrying.

## Efficient Sending

Each API request supports up to 50 recipients across the `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` fields combined. To minimize the number of API calls and stay within rate limits, always fill each request to capacity before sending the next.

```javascript
function chunkRecipients(recipients, size = 50) {
  const chunks = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < recipients.length; i += size) {
    chunks.push(recipients.slice(i, i + size));
  }
  return chunks;
}

async function sendToAll(recipients, emailPayload) {
  const chunks = chunkRecipients(recipients);

  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    await sendWithBackoff("https://app.lettr.com/api/emails", {
      ...emailPayload,
      to: chunk,
    });

    // Pause between requests to avoid hitting rate limits
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Sending to 10,000 recipients at 50 per request requires only 200 API calls. With a 1-second delay between each, that completes in under 4 minutes — well within the standard rate limit of 300 requests per 5 minutes.
</Tip>

## Monthly Email Quotas

Each plan includes a monthly email quota. Every recipient on every request counts toward this quota.

| Plan | Monthly Quota |
|------|--------------|
| Free | 3,000 emails |
| Pro 50K | 50,000 emails |
| Pro 100K | 100,000 emails |
| Pro 200K | 200,000 emails |
| Pro 500K | 500,000 emails |
| Pro 1M | 1,000,000 emails |
| Enterprise | Custom |

<Note>
  Emails beyond your tier limit are charged at $0.80 per 1,000 emails. Check your current plan details in the Lettr dashboard under **Settings > Billing**.
</Note>

---

## Monitoring Usage

You can track your current API usage and monthly email quota in the Lettr dashboard:

1. Go to **Dashboard > Usage** to view your current month's email volume.
2. Review your remaining quota and historical usage trends.
3. Set up alerts if your usage is approaching the plan limit.

<Tip>
  Check your usage regularly, especially when launching new campaigns or onboarding large recipient lists. This helps you avoid unexpected quota exhaustion mid-send.
</Tip>

---

## Queuing Strategies

For large sends, queue outbound requests and pace them with a controlled delay to stay within rate limits:

```javascript
async function processQueue(queue, emailPayload, delayMs = 1000) {
  const chunks = chunkRecipients(queue, 50);
  let sent = 0;

  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    try {
      await sendWithBackoff("https://app.lettr.com/api/emails", {
        ...emailPayload,
        to: chunk,
      });
      sent += chunk.length;
      console.log(`Sent ${sent} / ${queue.length}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed at ${sent} sent. Error: ${error.message}`);
      // Re-queue remaining recipients
      const remaining = queue.slice(sent);
      console.log(`Re-queuing ${remaining.length} recipients for retry.`);
      return processQueue(remaining, emailPayload, delayMs);
    }

    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs));
  }

  console.log(`All ${queue.length} recipients processed.`);
}
```

This approach uses a simple in-memory queue with `setTimeout` pacing. For production workloads, consider persisting the queue to a database so incomplete sends can be resumed after a restart.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement exponential backoff">
    Always handle `429` responses by reading the `retry_after` value and backing off exponentially. Never retry immediately — this worsens throttling and can extend the cooldown period.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch recipients efficiently">
    Include up to 50 recipients per API request. Sending one recipient per request wastes your rate limit allowance and dramatically slows throughput.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor usage in the dashboard">
    Regularly check your email volume and quota in the Lettr dashboard. Catching usage spikes early prevents disruptions to scheduled campaigns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use webhooks instead of polling">
    Rather than polling the API repeatedly to check email status, configure [webhooks](/learn/webhooks/introduction) to receive delivery events in real time. This eliminates unnecessary API calls and keeps you well under rate limits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Queue large sends">
    For sends to thousands of recipients, queue requests and pace them with a consistent delay. This avoids bursts that trigger rate limiting and gives you control over throughput.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Increasing Your Limits

If you are consistently hitting rate limits or approaching your monthly quota, you have two options:

1. **Upgrade your plan.** Higher plans include larger monthly quotas and access to high-volume rate limits. Visit **Settings > Billing** in the dashboard to compare plans.
2. **Contact sales for Enterprise.** If you need custom rate limits, dedicated infrastructure, or quotas beyond 500,000 emails per month, reach out to [sales@lettr.com](mailto:sales@lettr.com).

<Note>
  If you are experiencing rate limit issues that seem incorrect — for example, receiving `429` errors well below the documented thresholds — contact [support@lettr.com](mailto:support@lettr.com) with your API key prefix and timestamps of the affected requests.
