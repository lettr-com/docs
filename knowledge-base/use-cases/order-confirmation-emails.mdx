title: Order Confirmation Emails
description: "Structure, required information, delivery timing, and template design for e-commerce order confirmation emails"
---

Order confirmation emails have the highest open rates of any email type — often above 60%. They're the first touchpoint after a customer commits money, so they set expectations for the entire post-purchase experience. A missing or delayed confirmation creates immediate anxiety and support tickets. This guide covers what to include, how to structure the content, and how to deliver confirmations reliably.

## Why Order Confirmations Matter

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Highest open rates** | 60–80% open rates — far above marketing email benchmarks |
| **Legal requirement** | Many jurisdictions require a purchase confirmation or receipt |
| **Support deflection** | A clear confirmation reduces "did my order go through?" tickets |
| **Trust building** | Immediate confirmation reinforces trust in your platform |
| **Reference document** | Customers save and search for these emails later |

## Required Information

An order confirmation should include everything a customer needs to understand what they bought, what they paid, and what happens next.

### Essential Fields

<Steps>
  <Step title="Order number">
    A unique, human-readable identifier the customer can reference in support inquiries. Display it prominently at the top.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Items ordered">
    Product names, quantities, individual prices, and any selected variants (size, color, plan tier). Include product images where practical.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price breakdown">
    Subtotal, discounts or promo codes applied, tax, shipping cost, and total charged. Match exactly what the payment processor charged.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment method">
    Show the payment type and last four digits of the card (e.g., "Visa ending in 4242"). Never include the full card number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Shipping or delivery details">
    Delivery address, estimated delivery date or timeframe, and shipping method selected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next steps">
    What happens next — when they'll receive a shipping notification, how to track the order, or when to expect access (for digital products).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Optional but Recommended

- **Customer name** — personalize the greeting
- **Order date and time** — useful for record-keeping
- **Return/refund policy summary** — or a link to it
- **Support contact** — how to get help with the order
- **Account link** — where to view order status online

## Email Structure and Template

### HTML Template Example

```html
<div style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; color: #1a1a1a;">

  <!-- Header -->
  <div style="text-align: center; padding: 24px 0;">
    <h1 style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Order Confirmed</h1>
    <p style="color: #6b6b6b; margin: 8px 0 0;">
      Thank you for your order, {{customerName}}.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Order Number -->
  <div style="background-color: #f5f3ff; border-radius: 8px; padding: 16px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 24px;">
    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 14px; color: #6b6b6b;">Order Number</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px 0 0; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600;">#{{orderNumber}}</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Items -->
  <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;">
      <td style="padding: 12px 0;">
        <strong>{{itemName}}</strong><br>
        <span style="color: #6b6b6b; font-size: 14px;">Qty: {{quantity}} × {{unitPrice}}</span>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align: right; padding: 12px 0;">{{lineTotal}}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <!-- Totals -->
  <table style="width: 100%; margin-top: 16px;">
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 4px 0; color: #6b6b6b;">Subtotal</td>
      <td style="text-align: right;">{{subtotal}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 4px 0; color: #6b6b6b;">Shipping</td>
      <td style="text-align: right;">{{shippingCost}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 4px 0; color: #6b6b6b;">Tax</td>
      <td style="text-align: right;">{{tax}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-top: 2px solid #1a1a1a;">
      <td style="padding: 12px 0; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px;">Total</td>
      <td style="text-align: right; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px;">{{total}}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <!-- Shipping Info -->
  <div style="margin-top: 24px; padding: 16px; background-color: #f9fafb; border-radius: 8px;">
    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 8px; font-size: 16px;">Shipping To</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4a4a4a; line-height: 1.6;">
      {{shippingName}}<br>
      {{shippingAddress}}<br>
      {{shippingCity}}, {{shippingState}} {{shippingZip}}
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 12px 0 0; color: #6b6b6b; font-size: 14px;">
      Estimated delivery: {{estimatedDelivery}}
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CTA -->
  <div style="text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;">
    <a href="{{orderStatusUrl}}"
       style="background-color: #6366F1; color: #ffffff; padding: 12px 32px;
              text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 600;">
      View Order Status
    </a>
  </div>

  <!-- Footer -->
  <p style="color: #6b6b6b; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">
    Questions about your order? Contact us at
    <a href="mailto:support@yourstore.com" style="color: #6366F1;">support@yourstore.com</a>
  </p>
</div>
```

<Tip>
  Always include a plain-text version of the order confirmation. Some corporate email environments strip HTML, and plain text ensures the customer can always read their receipt.
</Tip>

## Sending with Lettr

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://app.lettr.com/api/emails', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.LETTR_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    from: 'orders@mail.yourstore.com',
    to: customer.email,
    subject: `Order confirmed — #${order.number}`,
    html: orderConfirmationHtml,
    text: orderConfirmationText,
    tags: ['order-confirmation'],
    metadata: {
      orderId: order.id,
      customerId: customer.id,
      orderTotal: order.total,
    },
  }),
});
```

<Note>
  Include the order number in the subject line. Customers often search their inbox for order numbers, and including it in the subject makes the email easy to find.
</Note>

## Delivery Timing

Order confirmations should arrive within seconds of the purchase. A delay — even a few minutes — triggers anxiety and support contacts.

### Best Practices for Fast Delivery

- **Send synchronously with the checkout flow** — trigger the email as part of the order completion process, not in a delayed background job
- **Don't batch order confirmations** — send each one individually as orders come in
- **Use a dedicated sending domain** with established reputation for transactional email
- **Monitor delivery latency** — track the time between your API call and the `email.delivered` webhook event

<Warning>
  If your order confirmation is delayed because it's queued behind a marketing campaign or bulk send, customers will contact support. Keep transactional email on a separate sending path from bulk email. See [Transactional vs Marketing](/knowledge-base/best-practices/transactional-vs-marketing).
</Warning>

### Handle Send Failures

If the email API call fails, don't fail the order — the customer has already been charged:

```javascript
async function completeOrder(order, customer) {
  // 1. Finalize the order in your database first
  await db.orders.markCompleted(order.id);

  // 2. Attempt to send confirmation
  try {
    await sendOrderConfirmation(order, customer);
  } catch (error) {
    // Log the failure but don't fail the order
    logger.error('Order confirmation email failed', {
      orderId: order.id,
      error: error.message,
    });

    // Queue a retry
    await queue.add('retryOrderConfirmation', {
      orderId: order.id,
      attempt: 1,
    });
  }
}
```

## Digital Products and SaaS

For digital products, subscriptions, or SaaS purchases, the confirmation email doubles as a delivery mechanism:

- **Include access instructions** — login URL, download link, or license key
- **Set access expectations** — "Your account is ready now" vs "Access will be provisioned within 5 minutes"
- **Provide getting-started guidance** — link to documentation or onboarding resources

```html
<div style="background-color: #f0fdf4; border-radius: 8px; padding: 16px; margin: 24px 0;">
  <h3 style="margin: 0 0 8px; font-size: 16px; color: #166534;">Your account is ready</h3>
  <p style="margin: 0; color: #4a4a4a; line-height: 1.6;">
    Log in to your dashboard to get started:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 16px;">
    <a href="{{dashboardUrl}}"
       style="background-color: #16a34a; color: #ffffff; padding: 10px 24px;
              text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 600;">
      Go to Dashboard
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Common Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing or inaccurate price breakdown">
    The total in the email must match what the customer was charged. Discrepancies — even from rounding — erode trust and can create legal issues. Calculate the email values from the same source as the payment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Including full payment details">
    Never show the full credit card number, CVV, or billing address. Show only the card type and last four digits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sending the confirmation from a no-reply address">
    Customers reply to order confirmation emails with questions, changes, or cancellation requests. Use a monitored address like `orders@` or `support@` so replies reach your team.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adding marketing content or upsells">
    Order confirmations are transactional. Adding promotional content degrades deliverability and may violate regulations. If you want to cross-sell, send a separate marketing email after a delay.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not including a plain-text version">
    Some email clients and corporate filters strip HTML. A plain-text version ensures every customer can read their receipt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Delaying send behind bulk queues">
    Order confirmations must arrive immediately. If they're queued behind bulk sends, customers assume the order failed. Use separate queues or priority levels.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
