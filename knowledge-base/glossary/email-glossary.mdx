# Email Glossary

A comprehensive reference of terms used across email infrastructure, deliverability, authentication, and compliance. Use this glossary alongside the [Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base/introduction) to build a complete understanding of how email works.

---

## A

### Aggregate Report (RUA)

A daily XML report sent by receiving mail servers to the address specified in your DMARC record. Aggregate reports summarize authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC pass/fail) for all emails received from your domain, helping you identify unauthorized senders and misconfigured services.

See [Understanding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/spf-dkim-dmarc).

### Alignment

In DMARC, alignment means the domain in the visible "From" header matches the domain that passed SPF or DKIM authentication. Without alignment, an email can pass SPF or DKIM but still fail DMARC. There are two modes: **strict** (exact domain match) and **relaxed** (organizational domain match, allowing subdomains).

See [Understanding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/spf-dkim-dmarc#alignment).

### AMP for Email

An email content type (`text/x-amp-html`) that allows interactive elements like carousels, forms, and live content within the email itself. Support is limited to Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Mail.ru. AMP emails require sender registration with each supporting provider.

See [Email Content Types](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/content-types).

### API Key

A secret token used to authenticate requests to the Lettr API. API keys should be stored in environment variables and never committed to source code or shared publicly. Each key can be scoped to specific permissions.

See [API Keys](/learn/api-keys/introduction) and [Security Best Practices](/knowledge-base/best-practices/security).

### Authentication-Results Header

An email header added by the receiving mail server that shows the pass/fail status of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. This header is the primary tool for diagnosing authentication issues.

See [Email Headers Explained](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/email-headers).

---

## B

### Backscatter

Bounce messages sent to an innocent third party whose email address was forged as the sender of spam. Proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configuration prevents your domain from being used in backscatter attacks.

### Batch Sending

Sending a single API request with multiple recipients rather than making individual requests per recipient. Lettr supports up to 50 recipients per batch request. Batch sending reduces API calls and improves throughput for high-volume senders.

See [Batch Sending](/learn/sending/batch-sending).

### Blocklist (Blacklist)

A database of IP addresses or domains identified as sources of spam. Mailbox providers and spam filters check incoming email against blocklists. Being listed on a major blocklist (Spamhaus, Barracuda, SORBS) can severely impact deliverability. Monitor your status and request delisting if listed.

See [Sending Reputation](/knowledge-base/best-practices/sending-reputation).

### Bounce

An email that cannot be delivered to the recipient. Bounces are classified as **hard** (permanent failure, e.g., address doesn't exist) or **soft** (temporary failure, e.g., mailbox full). Hard bounces should result in immediate suppression. Soft bounces are retried automatically.

See [Bounce Codes Reference](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/bounce-codes-reference) and [Bounce Diagnosis](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/bounce-diagnosis).

### Bounce Rate

The percentage of sent emails that bounce. A healthy bounce rate is below 2%. Rates above 5% indicate a list quality problem and can damage sender reputation. Calculate as: `(bounced emails / sent emails) x 100`.

See [Bounce Diagnosis](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/bounce-diagnosis).

### Bulk Sender

In the context of Google and Yahoo's 2024 requirements, any sender who sends 5,000 or more emails per day to Gmail or Yahoo recipients. Bulk senders must implement SPF, DKIM, DMARC, one-click unsubscribe, and maintain a spam complaint rate below 0.3%.

See [Google & Yahoo Sender Requirements](/knowledge-base/compliance/google-yahoo-requirements).

---

## C

### CAN-SPAM Act

A US federal law (2003) governing commercial email. Requires accurate header information, non-deceptive subject lines, identification as an advertisement, a physical mailing address, a working unsubscribe mechanism (honored within 10 business days), and responsible monitoring of third-party senders. Penalties reach $50,120 per non-compliant email.

See [CAN-SPAM Requirements](/knowledge-base/compliance/can-spam).

### CNAME Record

A DNS record type that creates an alias from one domain name to another. Lettr uses CNAME records for sending domain verification and tracking domain configuration. A CNAME points your subdomain to Lettr's infrastructure, delegating email authentication.

### Complaint

When a recipient marks an email as spam or junk in their email client. Complaints are reported back to senders through [feedback loops](#feedback-loop-fbl). A complaint rate above 0.1% is a warning sign; above 0.3% risks deliverability penalties from major providers.

See [List Hygiene](/knowledge-base/best-practices/list-hygiene).

### Content Filtering

The process by which receiving mail servers analyze email content (subject lines, body text, HTML structure, links, images) to determine whether a message is spam. Filters use machine learning, keyword analysis, URL reputation, and sender history.

See [Emails Landing in Spam](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/spam-placement).

---

## D

### Dedicated IP

An IP address assigned exclusively to a single sender. Dedicated IPs give you full control over your sending reputation, since no other sender's behavior affects your IP. They require a [warm-up](#warm-up) period and consistent sending volume to maintain reputation. Best suited for senders with 100,000+ emails per month.

### Deliverability

The ability of an email to reach the recipient's inbox (as opposed to the spam folder, or being rejected entirely). Deliverability is influenced by sender reputation, authentication, content quality, list hygiene, and engagement metrics. Distinct from **delivery**, which simply means the receiving server accepted the message.

See [Deliverability Best Practices](/knowledge-base/best-practices/deliverability).

### Delivery

The act of a receiving mail server accepting an email. A "delivered" email has been accepted by the recipient's server, but may still be placed in spam, a promotions tab, or another folder. Delivery does not guarantee inbox placement.

See [How Email Delivery Works](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/how-email-delivery-works).

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

An email authentication protocol that adds a cryptographic signature to outgoing messages. The receiving server uses a public key published in DNS to verify that the email was authorized by the domain owner and wasn't modified in transit. Unlike SPF, DKIM survives email forwarding.

See [Understanding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/spf-dkim-dmarc#dkim-domainkeys-identified-mail).

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

A policy framework built on SPF and DKIM that tells receiving servers what to do when authentication fails. DMARC adds alignment checks and provides a reporting mechanism. Policies range from `p=none` (monitor only) to `p=reject` (block unauthenticated email).

See [Understanding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/spf-dkim-dmarc#dmarc-domain-based-message-authentication-reporting--conformance).

### DNS (Domain Name System)

The system that translates domain names into IP addresses and stores records used for email routing and authentication. Email relies on DNS for MX records (mail routing), TXT records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and CNAME records (domain delegation).

### DNS Propagation

The time it takes for DNS record changes to spread across DNS servers worldwide. Propagation typically completes within 1–2 hours but can take up to 48 hours. During propagation, some servers may see the old records while others see the new ones.

See [Domain Verification](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/domain-verification).

### Double Opt-In

A signup process where a new subscriber must confirm their email address by clicking a link in a confirmation email before being added to a mailing list. Double opt-in ensures valid addresses, reduces bounces, and provides documented proof of consent for GDPR compliance.

See [GDPR and Email Sending](/knowledge-base/compliance/gdpr-email).

---

## E

### Engagement

How recipients interact with your emails — opens, clicks, replies, forwards, and time spent reading. Mailbox providers use engagement signals to determine inbox placement. High engagement improves deliverability; low engagement signals that recipients don't want your email.

### Enhanced Status Code

A three-part code (e.g., `5.1.1`) included in SMTP bounce responses that provides more detail than the basic three-digit reply code. The format is `class.subject.detail`, where the class indicates success (2), temporary failure (4), or permanent failure (5).

See [Bounce Codes Reference](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/bounce-codes-reference).

### Envelope From (Return-Path)

The email address used during the SMTP conversation to indicate where bounce messages should be sent. This is different from the "From" header that recipients see. SPF checks are performed against the envelope from domain. Also called the **bounce address** or **MAIL FROM**.

See [Email Headers Explained](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/email-headers).

### ESP (Email Service Provider)

A company that provides infrastructure and tools for sending email at scale. ESPs handle server management, IP reputation, authentication, deliverability optimization, and compliance. Lettr is an ESP focused on transactional email.

---

## F

### Feedback Loop (FBL)

A service provided by mailbox providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) that notifies senders when recipients mark their email as spam. Senders register for FBLs to receive complaint notifications and are expected to suppress complaining recipients immediately. Lettr processes FBL reports automatically and adds complainers to your suppression list.

### Forensic Report (RUF)

A DMARC report that provides detailed information about individual emails that failed authentication. Unlike aggregate reports (which are summaries), forensic reports include message headers or full message content. Many mailbox providers do not send forensic reports due to privacy concerns.

### From Header

The email address displayed to the recipient as the sender. This is the address that DMARC alignment checks against. It can differ from the [envelope from](#envelope-from-return-path), which is used for SMTP delivery and bounce handling.

---

## G

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

An EU regulation governing the processing of personal data, including email addresses. For email senders, GDPR requires a lawful basis for processing (consent, legitimate interest, or contractual necessity), grants data subjects rights (access, erasure, portability), and mandates privacy notices and data protection measures.

See [GDPR and Email Sending](/knowledge-base/compliance/gdpr-email).

### Graymail

Email that isn't spam but isn't wanted either — newsletters the recipient signed up for but no longer reads, promotional emails from legitimate companies, etc. Graymail hurts engagement metrics and can affect deliverability over time.

### Graylisting

A spam-fighting technique where a receiving server temporarily rejects an email from an unknown sender, expecting the legitimate sending server to retry later. Spammers often don't retry. Graylisting causes a brief delivery delay (typically 5–30 minutes) for first-time senders. Lettr handles retries automatically.

---

## H

### Hard Bounce

A permanent delivery failure indicating the email can never be delivered to that address. Common causes: the address doesn't exist (SMTP 550), the domain doesn't exist, or the mailbox has been disabled. Hard bounces should be immediately suppressed to protect sender reputation.

See [Bounce Diagnosis](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/bounce-diagnosis).

### Header

Metadata at the top of an email message containing routing information, authentication results, and display information (From, To, Subject, Date, Message-ID, etc.). Headers are normally hidden from the recipient but can be viewed in most email clients via "Show Original" or "View Source."

See [Email Headers Explained](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/email-headers).

---

## I

### Idempotency

The property of an API operation where making the same request multiple times produces the same result as making it once. Lettr supports idempotent email sending via an `Idempotency-Key` header, preventing duplicate emails if a request is retried due to a network error.

See [Idempotency](/learn/sending/idempotency).

### Inbox Placement

Whether an email appears in the recipient's primary inbox, as opposed to the spam folder, promotions tab, or other filtered location. Inbox placement is determined by sender reputation, authentication, content quality, and recipient engagement.

### IP Reputation

A score assigned to an IP address based on the quality and history of email sent from it. Mailbox providers track bounce rates, complaint rates, spam trap hits, and engagement from each IP. A poor IP reputation leads to spam filtering or rejection.

See [Sending Reputation](/knowledge-base/best-practices/sending-reputation).

---

## L

### List Hygiene

The practice of maintaining a clean, valid email list by removing invalid addresses, handling bounces, processing complaints, re-engaging or sunsetting inactive subscribers, and validating addresses at collection. Poor list hygiene is the most common cause of deliverability problems.

See [List Hygiene](/knowledge-base/best-practices/list-hygiene).

### List-Unsubscribe Header

An email header that provides a machine-readable unsubscribe mechanism. Google and Yahoo require the `List-Unsubscribe-Post` header (RFC 8058) for one-click unsubscribe in bulk email. Lettr adds this header automatically when unsubscribe tracking is enabled.

See [Unsubscribe Best Practices](/knowledge-base/compliance/unsubscribe-best-practices).

---

## M

### MAIL FROM

The command in an SMTP conversation that specifies the envelope sender address (also called the [return-path](#envelope-from-return-path) or bounce address). This is the address that receives bounce notifications and is checked by SPF. It can differ from the "From" header the recipient sees.

### Marketing Email

Email sent to promote a product, service, or offer. Marketing email requires explicit recipient consent (opt-in), must include an unsubscribe mechanism and physical address, and is subject to CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and other regulations. Should be sent separately from transactional email to protect transactional reputation.

See [Transactional vs Marketing](/knowledge-base/best-practices/transactional-vs-marketing).

### Message-ID

A unique identifier assigned to every email, formatted as `<unique-string@domain>`. Used for threading, deduplication, and troubleshooting. Each email should have exactly one Message-ID, generated by the sending system.

See [Email Headers Explained](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/email-headers).

### MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)

A standard that extends email to support content beyond plain ASCII text — HTML, images, attachments, and multiple content types in a single message. MIME defines content types (`text/plain`, `text/html`, `multipart/alternative`) and encoding methods.

See [Email Content Types](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/content-types).

### MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)

Software responsible for sending, receiving, and routing email between servers using the SMTP protocol. Examples include Postfix, Sendmail, and Microsoft Exchange. When you send email through Lettr, Lettr's MTA handles delivery to the recipient's MTA.

### Multipart Message

An email that contains multiple content versions (typically `text/plain` and `text/html`) wrapped in a `multipart/alternative` MIME container. The recipient's email client chooses which version to display based on its capabilities and user preferences. Sending multipart messages is a best practice for accessibility and deliverability.

See [Email Content Types](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/content-types).

### MX Record (Mail Exchanger)

A DNS record that specifies which mail server should receive email for a domain. MX records include a priority value — lower numbers indicate higher priority. When sending email, the sending server queries the recipient domain's MX records to find the correct destination.

---

## O

### One-Click Unsubscribe

An unsubscribe mechanism defined by RFC 8058 that allows mailbox providers to show an unsubscribe button in their UI. It requires the `List-Unsubscribe` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers. Since February 2024, Google and Yahoo require one-click unsubscribe for bulk senders.

See [Unsubscribe Best Practices](/knowledge-base/compliance/unsubscribe-best-practices) and [Google & Yahoo Sender Requirements](/knowledge-base/compliance/google-yahoo-requirements).

### Open Tracking

A technique that detects when a recipient opens an email by embedding an invisible tracking pixel (a 1x1 image). When the email client loads the image, the open is recorded. Open tracking is unreliable because images may be blocked, pre-fetched by privacy features (Apple Mail Privacy Protection), or loaded by security scanners.

See [Tracking Accuracy](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/tracking-accuracy).

---

## P

### Phishing

A social engineering attack where a fraudulent email impersonates a trusted sender to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC help prevent attackers from spoofing your domain in phishing emails.

### Preference Center

A web page where recipients can manage their email subscription settings — choosing which types of email they want to receive rather than unsubscribing entirely. Preference centers reduce unsubscribes and complaints by giving recipients control.

See [Unsubscribe Best Practices](/knowledge-base/compliance/unsubscribe-best-practices).

---

## R

### Rate Limiting

A server's restriction on how many requests or emails a sender can submit within a given time period. Lettr enforces rate limits to protect infrastructure and deliverability (standard: 300 requests per 5 minutes). Exceeding limits returns a 429 HTTP status code with a `retry_after` value.

See [Rate Limits](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/rate-limits) and [Rate Limits](/learn/sending/rate-limits).

### Reply-To Header

An email header that specifies where replies should be sent, which can differ from the "From" address. Useful when the sending address is a no-reply address but you want replies to go to a support or sales inbox.

### Return-Path

See [Envelope From (Return-Path)](#envelope-from-return-path).

---

## S

### Seed List

A list of test email addresses across multiple mailbox providers used to verify inbox placement. Sending to seed lists helps diagnose deliverability issues by checking whether emails land in the inbox or spam folder at Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and other providers.

### Sender Reputation

A score or classification assigned to your sending domain and/or IP address by mailbox providers, based on historical sending behavior. Factors include bounce rate, complaint rate, spam trap hits, engagement, and sending consistency. Reputation is the single biggest factor in deliverability.

See [Sending Reputation](/knowledge-base/best-practices/sending-reputation).

### Shared IP

An IP address used by multiple senders on the same email platform. Your deliverability is partially influenced by the behavior of other senders sharing the IP. Shared IPs are the default for most email platforms (including Lettr) and work well for most sending volumes.

### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

The standard protocol for transmitting email between servers. SMTP operates on port 25 (server-to-server), port 587 (submission with STARTTLS), and port 465 (submission with implicit TLS). SMTP defines the conversation between sending and receiving servers, including commands like EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA.

### Soft Bounce

A temporary delivery failure indicating the email could not be delivered right now but may succeed later. Common causes: mailbox full (SMTP 452), server temporarily unavailable (421), or message too large (552). Soft bounces are retried automatically. Persistent soft bounces may be reclassified as hard bounces.

See [Bounce Diagnosis](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/bounce-diagnosis).

### Spam Trap

An email address used by mailbox providers and blocklist operators to identify senders with poor list practices. **Pristine traps** are addresses that never opted in — hitting one means you're using a purchased or scraped list. **Recycled traps** are abandoned addresses repurposed as traps — hitting one means you're not cleaning inactive subscribers.

See [List Hygiene](/knowledge-base/best-practices/list-hygiene).

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

An email authentication protocol that allows domain owners to declare which mail servers are authorized to send email on their behalf. SPF is published as a DNS TXT record. Receiving servers check the sending server's IP against the SPF record. SPF does not survive email forwarding.

See [Understanding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/spf-dkim-dmarc#spf-sender-policy-framework).

### Subdomain

A prefix added to a root domain (e.g., `mail.yourdomain.com` is a subdomain of `yourdomain.com`). Using subdomains for email sending provides reputation isolation — deliverability issues on one subdomain don't affect others or your root domain.

See [Subdomain vs Root Domain](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/subdomain-vs-root).

### Substitution Data

Variables passed in an API request that are merged into an email template at send time (e.g., `{{first_name}}`, `{{order_id}}`). Substitution data is processed per-recipient and should never contain sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.

See [Data Privacy in Email Metadata](/knowledge-base/compliance/data-privacy-metadata).

### Sunset Policy

A rule that automatically removes or suppresses recipients who haven't engaged with your email over a defined period (e.g., no opens or clicks in 90 days). Sunset policies prevent list decay, reduce complaints from disengaged recipients, and protect sender reputation.

See [List Hygiene](/knowledge-base/best-practices/list-hygiene) and [Sending Reputation](/knowledge-base/best-practices/sending-reputation).

### Suppression List

A list of email addresses that Lettr will not send to, regardless of whether they appear in a send request. Addresses are added automatically (hard bounces, complaints, unsubscribes) or manually. Suppression lists protect sender reputation by preventing email to known-bad addresses.

See [Understanding Suppression Lists](/knowledge-base/fundamentals/suppression-lists).

---

## T

### TLS (Transport Layer Security)

An encryption protocol that secures the connection between mail servers during SMTP transmission. TLS prevents eavesdropping on email content in transit. Most modern mail servers support opportunistic TLS (encrypt if both sides support it, fall back to unencrypted if not).

### Tracking Domain

A custom domain used for open and click tracking instead of Lettr's default tracking domain. Using a tracking domain that matches your sending domain improves deliverability and brand consistency. Tracking domains require CNAME records pointing to Lettr's tracking infrastructure.

See [Tracking Domains](/learn/domains/tracking-domains).

### Tracking Pixel

A tiny (1x1 pixel) invisible image embedded in an HTML email to detect opens. When the recipient's email client loads the image, the open event is recorded. Tracking pixels are the standard open-tracking method but are blocked by some email clients and privacy features.

See [Tracking Accuracy](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/tracking-accuracy).

### Transactional Email

Email triggered by a user action or system event — password resets, order confirmations, shipping notifications, account alerts, and similar. Transactional email is expected by the recipient and typically has high open rates. It is generally exempt from CAN-SPAM's unsubscribe requirements but must still include accurate sender information.

See [Transactional vs Marketing](/knowledge-base/best-practices/transactional-vs-marketing).

### TXT Record

A DNS record type used to store text data. Email authentication relies heavily on TXT records: SPF policies, DKIM public keys, and DMARC policies are all published as TXT records.

---

## W

### Warm-Up

The process of gradually increasing email volume from a new IP address or domain to build sender reputation with mailbox providers. Warm-up typically takes 2–4 weeks. Sending too much too fast from a new IP or domain triggers spam filters and can permanently damage reputation.

See [Sending Reputation](/knowledge-base/best-practices/sending-reputation).

### Webhook

An HTTP callback triggered by an event. Lettr sends webhooks to your configured endpoint when email events occur (delivered, bounced, opened, clicked, complained, etc.). Webhooks enable real-time event processing in your application.

See [Webhooks](/learn/webhooks/introduction).
