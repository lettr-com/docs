# Deliverability Best Practices

Ensure your emails reach the inbox, not spam.

## Authentication Setup

### Complete DNS Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="CNAME Record">
    Verifies domain ownership.
    ```
    CNAME: @ → sparkpostmail.com
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="DKIM Record">
    Signs emails cryptographically.
    ```
    TXT: {selector}._domainkey → v=DKIM1; k=rsa; h=sha256; p=...
    ```
    The selector and public key are provided when you add your domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="DMARC Record">
    Sets policy for failed authentication.
    ```
    TXT: _dmarc → v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sender Reputation

### Warm Up New Domains

Don't send large volumes immediately. Ramp up gradually:

| Week | Daily Volume |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | 50-100 |
| 2 | 200-500 |
| 3 | 1,000-2,000 |
| 4 | 5,000+ |

### Monitor Reputation

```javascript
const reputation = await lettr.domains.getReputation('dom_123');

// Target: score > 80
console.log({
  score: reputation.score,
  bounceRate: reputation.bounceRate,  // Keep < 2%
  spamRate: reputation.spamRate       // Keep < 0.1%
});
```

## List Hygiene

### Remove Invalid Addresses

Process bounces immediately:

```javascript
app.post('/webhooks', (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.type === 'email.bounced') {
    const { to, bounceType } = req.body.data;
    
    if (bounceType === 'hard') {
      removeFromList(to);
    }
  }
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

### Use Double Opt-In

Confirm subscriptions before sending:

```javascript
// 1. User signs up
await sendConfirmationEmail(email);

// 2. User clicks link
await confirmSubscription(email);

// 3. Now safe to send marketing emails
```

### Remove Unengaged Subscribers

Stop sending to users who never open:

```javascript
// Find subscribers with no opens in 6 months
const unengaged = await db.subscribers.findAll({
  where: {
    lastOpenedAt: { $lt: sixMonthsAgo }
  }
});

// Remove or re-engage them
```

## Content Best Practices

### Subject Lines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do: Be clear and relevant">
    "Your order #12345 has shipped"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't: Use spam triggers">
    "FREE!!! LIMITED TIME OFFER!!!"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Email Body

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Balance text and images | Use only images |
| Include plain text version | Send HTML only |
| Add unsubscribe link | Hide unsubscribe |
| Use your domain for links | Use URL shorteners |

### Required Elements

Always include:

- Physical mailing address
- Unsubscribe link (one-click preferred)
- Reply-to address

## Engagement Metrics

### Track and Improve

| Metric | Target | Action if Low |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Open Rate | > 20% | Improve subject lines |
| Click Rate | > 2% | Better CTAs |
| Bounce Rate | < 2% | Clean list |
| Spam Rate | < 0.1% | Review content |

## Testing

### Before Sending

1. **Spam check** - Use tools to scan for spam triggers
2. **Preview** - Check rendering in multiple clients
3. **Test send** - Send to yourself first
4. **Links** - Verify all links work

### A/B Testing

```javascript
const campaign = await lettr.campaigns.create({
  variants: [
    { subject: 'Version A', weight: 50 },
    { subject: 'Version B', weight: 50 }
  ],
  testSettings: {
    testPercentage: 20,
    winnerCriteria: 'open_rate'
  }
});
```
