# Email Bounces

Bounces occur when an email cannot be delivered to the recipient. Understanding different bounce types and handling them correctly is essential for maintaining good deliverability.

## Bounce Types

### Hard Bounces

Hard bounces are permanent delivery failures. The recipient's mail server has definitively rejected the email, and retrying will not succeed.

**Common causes:**
- Email address doesn't exist
- Domain doesn't exist
- Recipient has blocked the sender
- Mailbox has been deactivated

```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "type": "email.bounced",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z",
  "data": {
    "emailId": "email_123",
    "requestId": "req_456",
    "to": "invalid@nonexistent.com",
    "bounceType": "hard",
    "bounceCategory": "invalid_address",
    "bounceCode": "550",
    "message": "550 5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist",
    "bouncedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Hard-bounced addresses are automatically suppressed and should be removed from your mailing lists. Continuing to send to these addresses damages your sender reputation.
</Warning>

### Soft Bounces

Soft bounces are temporary delivery failures. The email might be deliverable if retried later.

**Common causes:**
- Mailbox is full
- Server is temporarily unavailable
- Message is too large
- Rate limiting by the recipient server

```json
{
  "id": "evt_def456",
  "type": "email.bounced",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z",
  "data": {
    "emailId": "email_456",
    "requestId": "req_789",
    "to": "full@example.com",
    "bounceType": "soft",
    "bounceCategory": "mailbox_full",
    "bounceCode": "452",
    "message": "452 4.2.2 Mailbox full",
    "bouncedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z"
  }
}
```

Lettr automatically retries soft bounces with exponential backoff. If delivery continues to fail, the address may eventually be suppressed.

## Automatic Handling

## Bounce Categories

| Category | Type | Description | Recommended Action |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `invalid_address` | Hard | Email address doesn't exist | Remove from list |
| `domain_not_found` | Hard | Domain doesn't exist or has no mail server | Remove from list |
| `mailbox_full` | Soft | Recipient's mailbox is over quota | Wait and retry |
| `blocked` | Hard | Recipient or their server blocked delivery | Investigate and remove |
| `spam_related` | Hard | Rejected due to spam detection | Review content |
| `policy_related` | Hard | Rejected due to server policy | Contact recipient |
| `server_error` | Soft | Temporary server-side issue | Automatic retry |
| `protocol_error` | Soft | Technical delivery problem | Automatic retry |
| `unknown` | Varies | Unclassified bounce | Review manually |

## Handling Bounces

### Webhook Integration

The most reliable way to handle bounces is through webhooks. Set up a webhook endpoint to receive `email.bounced` events:

```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/lettr', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  if (event.type === 'email.bounced') {
    const {
      to,
      bounceType,
      bounceCategory,
      bounceCode,
      message
    } = event.data;

    // Log the bounce for analysis
    await logBounce({
      email: to,
      type: bounceType,
      category: bounceCategory,
      code: bounceCode,
      message: message,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });

    if (bounceType === 'hard') {
      // Remove from mailing list immediately
      await db.subscribers.update({
        where: { email: to },
        data: {
          status: 'bounced',
          bounceType: bounceCategory,
          lastBounceAt: new Date()
        }
      });

      // Notify relevant team members
      if (bounceCategory === 'blocked' || bounceCategory === 'spam_related') {
        await notifyTeam({
          type: 'reputation_concern',
          email: to,
          reason: message
        });
      }
    }
  }

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

### Querying Email Events

You can retrieve bounce events for specific emails using the API:

```bash
curl "https://app.lettr.com/api/emails/req_456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response includes all events for that email, including bounces:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "requestId": "req_456",
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "injection",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "rcpt_to": "recipient@example.com"
      },
      {
        "type": "bounce",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z",
        "rcpt_to": "recipient@example.com",
        "reason": "550 5.1.1 User unknown",
        "raw_reason": "550 5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist",
        "error_code": "550"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Listing Bounces via SDK

You can also query bounces and statistics using the Lettr SDK:

```javascript
// List all bounces for a date range
const bounces = await lettr.bounces.list({
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31'
});

// Get bounce rate statistics
const stats = await lettr.stats.get({
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31'
});

console.log(`Bounce rate: ${stats.bounceRate}%`);
```

## Bounce Rate Guidelines

Monitor your bounce rates to maintain good deliverability:

| Bounce Rate | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| < 2% | Healthy | Maintain current practices |
| 2-5% | Warning | Review list hygiene |
| > 5% | Critical | Clean list immediately |

<Note>
  ISPs closely monitor bounce rates. A bounce rate consistently above 5% can result in your emails being blocked or filtered to spam.
</Note>

## Preventing Bounces

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Double Opt-In">
    Require subscribers to confirm their email address before adding them to your list. This ensures addresses are valid and owned by the person who signed up.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validate on Collection">
    Use email validation at the point of collection. Check for common typos, invalid formats, and disposable email addresses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clean Lists Regularly">
    Remove subscribers who haven't engaged in 6-12 months. Inactive addresses are more likely to bounce over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Process Bounces Immediately">
    Set up webhook handlers to process bounce events in real-time. Don't wait for batch processing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Engagement">
    Track open and click rates. Low engagement often precedes bounces as users abandon email addresses.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deferred Delivery

Sometimes emails are temporarily delayed rather than bounced. Lettr tracks these as `email.deferred` events:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_jkl012",
  "type": "email.deferred",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z",
  "data": {
    "emailId": "email_123",
    "requestId": "req_456",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "reason": "421 Server temporarily unavailable",
    "retryCount": 1,
    "nextRetryAt": "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z",
    "deferredAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z"
  }
}
```

Deferred emails are automatically retried. You don't need to take action unless deferrals persist, which may indicate a delivery issue.

## Out-of-Band Bounces

Some bounces arrive asynchronously after the initial delivery attempt appears successful. These are called out-of-band (OOB) bounces:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_oob789",
  "type": "email.out_of_band",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "emailId": "email_123",
    "requestId": "req_456",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "reason": "552 5.2.2 Mailbox full",
    "bouncedAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Handle OOB bounces the same way as regular bounces—update your records and suppress hard bounces.
