Bounces occur when an email cannot be delivered to the recipient. Understanding different bounce types and handling them correctly is essential for maintaining good deliverability.

## Bounce Types

### Hard Bounces

Hard bounces are permanent delivery failures. The recipient's mail server has definitively rejected the email, and retrying will not succeed.

**Common causes:**
- Email address doesn't exist
- Domain doesn't exist
- Recipient has blocked the sender
- Mailbox has been deactivated

When a hard bounce occurs, you receive a `message.bounce` webhook event. Hard bounces use bounce classes in the 10–30 and 100 ranges:

```json
[{
  "msys": {
    "message_event": {
      "type": "bounce",
      "timestamp": "1705312205",
      "transmission_id": "12345678",
      "message_id": "abcd-1234-efgh",
      "rcpt_to": "invalid@nonexistent.com",
      "bounce_class": "10",
      "error_code": "550",
      "reason": "User Unknown",
      "raw_reason": "550 5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist",
      "friendly_from": "you@example.com",
      "subject": "Your Order Confirmation",
      "sending_ip": "192.168.1.1"
    }
  }
}]
```

<Warning>
  Hard-bounced addresses are automatically suppressed and should be removed from your mailing lists. Continuing to send to these addresses damages your sender reputation.
</Warning>

### Soft Bounces

Soft bounces are temporary delivery failures. The email might be deliverable if retried later.

**Common causes:**
- Mailbox is full
- Server is temporarily unavailable
- Message is too large
- Rate limiting by the recipient server

Soft bounces use bounce classes in the 20–70 ranges:

```json
[{
  "msys": {
    "message_event": {
      "type": "bounce",
      "timestamp": "1705312205",
      "transmission_id": "12345678",
      "message_id": "abcd-5678-efgh",
      "rcpt_to": "full@example.com",
      "bounce_class": "22",
      "error_code": "452",
      "reason": "Mailbox Full",
      "raw_reason": "452 4.2.2 Mailbox full",
      "friendly_from": "you@example.com",
      "subject": "Your Weekly Update",
      "sending_ip": "192.168.1.1"
    }
  }
}]
```

Lettr automatically retries soft bounces with exponential backoff. If delivery continues to fail, the address may eventually be suppressed.

## Automatic Handling

Lettr automatically handles bounces for you:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tracks Bounces">
    All bounces are logged and tracked in your dashboard with full details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Suppresses Hard Bounces">
    Hard-bounced addresses are automatically added to your suppression list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retries Soft Bounces">
    Soft bounces are automatically retried with exponential backoff.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sends Webhooks">
    Bounce events are sent to your configured webhook endpoints in real-time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bounce Classes

Lettr uses numeric bounce classes to categorize bounces. These correspond to the `bounce_class` field in webhook events:

| Bounce Class | Category | Type | Description | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `1` | Undetermined | Varies | Bounce could not be classified | Review manually |
| `10` | Invalid Recipient | Hard | Email address does not exist | Remove from list |
| `20` | Soft Bounce | Soft | General temporary failure | Automatic retry |
| `21` | DNS Failure | Soft | Domain DNS lookup failed temporarily | Automatic retry |
| `22` | Mailbox Full | Soft | Recipient's mailbox is over quota | Wait and retry |
| `25` | Admin Failure | Soft | Mailbox admin-related issue | Review and retry |
| `30` | Generic Bounce (no RCPT) | Hard | Rejected without valid recipient | Remove from list |
| `40` | Generic Bounce | Soft | Temporary generic failure | Automatic retry |
| `50` | Mail Block (General) | Soft | Blocked by receiving server | Investigate |
| `51` | Mail Block (Spam Related) | Soft | Blocked as spam by receiving server | Review content |
| `52` | Mail Block (Content) | Soft | Blocked due to content filtering | Review content |
| `60` | Auto-Reply | N/A | Automatic reply (vacation, etc.) | No action needed |
| `70` | Transient Failure | Soft | Temporary infrastructure issue | Automatic retry |
| `100` | Relay Denied | Hard | Relay not permitted | Remove from list |

<Note>
  Hard bounce classes (10, 30, 100) result in automatic suppression. Soft bounce classes may lead to suppression if delivery continues to fail after retries.
</Note>

## Handling Bounces

### Webhook Integration

The most reliable way to handle bounces is through webhooks. Set up a webhook endpoint to receive `message.bounce` events:

```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/lettr', express.json(), async (req, res) => {
  res.sendStatus(200);

  for (const event of req.body) {
    const eventType = Object.keys(event.msys)[0];
    const data = event.msys[eventType];

    if (data.type === 'bounce') {
      const bounceClass = parseInt(data.bounce_class);

      // Log the bounce for analysis
      await logBounce({
        email: data.rcpt_to,
        bounceClass: bounceClass,
        errorCode: data.error_code,
        reason: data.raw_reason,
        timestamp: new Date(parseInt(data.timestamp) * 1000)
      });

      // Hard bounce classes: 10 (invalid recipient), 30 (no RCPT), 100 (relay denied)
      if ([10, 30, 100].includes(bounceClass)) {
        // Remove from mailing list immediately
        await db.subscribers.update({
          where: { email: data.rcpt_to },
          data: {
            status: 'bounced',
            bounceClass: bounceClass,
            lastBounceAt: new Date()
          }
        });

        // Notify relevant team members for spam-related blocks
        if ([50, 51, 52].includes(bounceClass)) {
          await notifyTeam({
            type: 'reputation_concern',
            email: data.rcpt_to,
            reason: data.raw_reason
          });
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Querying Email Events

You can retrieve events for specific emails using the API:

```bash
curl "https://app.lettr.com/api/emails/12345678" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lttr_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The response includes all events for that email, including bounces:

```json
{
  "message": "Email retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "results": [
      {
        "event_id": "evt-abc-123",
        "type": "injection",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
        "request_id": "12345678",
        "rcpt_to": "recipient@example.com",
        "subject": "Your Order Confirmation",
        "friendly_from": "you@example.com"
      },
      {
        "event_id": "evt-def-456",
        "type": "bounce",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:05.000Z",
        "request_id": "12345678",
        "rcpt_to": "recipient@example.com",
        "reason": "User Unknown",
        "raw_reason": "550 5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist",
        "error_code": "550"
      }
    ],
    "total_count": 2
  }
}
```

## Bounce Rate Guidelines

Monitor your bounce rates to maintain good deliverability:

| Bounce Rate | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| < 2% | Healthy | Maintain current practices |
| 2-5% | Warning | Review list hygiene |
| > 5% | Critical | Clean list immediately |

<Note>
  ISPs closely monitor bounce rates. A bounce rate consistently above 5% can result in your emails being blocked or filtered to spam.
</Note>

## Preventing Bounces

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Double Opt-In">
    Require subscribers to confirm their email address before adding them to your list. This ensures addresses are valid and owned by the person who signed up.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validate on Collection">
    Use email validation at the point of collection. Check for common typos, invalid formats, and disposable email addresses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clean Lists Regularly">
    Remove subscribers who haven't engaged in 6-12 months. Inactive addresses are more likely to bounce over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Process Bounces Immediately">
    Set up webhook handlers to process bounce events in real-time. Don't wait for batch processing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Engagement">
    Track open and click rates. Low engagement often precedes bounces as users abandon email addresses.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Delayed Delivery

Sometimes emails are temporarily delayed rather than bounced. These are tracked as `message.delay` events:

```json
[{
  "msys": {
    "message_event": {
      "type": "delay",
      "timestamp": "1705312205",
      "transmission_id": "12345678",
      "message_id": "abcd-1234-efgh",
      "rcpt_to": "recipient@example.com",
      "reason": "421 Server temporarily unavailable",
      "friendly_from": "you@example.com",
      "subject": "Your Order Confirmation",
      "sending_ip": "192.168.1.1",
      "num_retries": "1"
    }
  }
}]
```

Delayed emails are automatically retried. You don't need to take action unless delays persist, which may indicate a delivery issue.

## Out-of-Band Bounces

Some bounces arrive asynchronously after the initial delivery attempt appears successful. These are called out-of-band (OOB) bounces and are tracked as `message.out_of_band` events:

```json
[{
  "msys": {
    "message_event": {
      "type": "out_of_band",
      "timestamp": "1705314000",
      "transmission_id": "12345678",
      "message_id": "abcd-1234-efgh",
      "rcpt_to": "recipient@example.com",
      "bounce_class": "22",
      "reason": "Mailbox Full",
      "raw_reason": "552 5.2.2 Mailbox full",
      "error_code": "552"
    }
  }
}]
```

Handle OOB bounces the same way as regular bounces — update your records and suppress hard bounces.
