# Suppressions

Suppressions prevent emails from being sent to specific addresses, protecting your sender reputation.

## What Are Suppressions?

Suppressed addresses are email addresses that should not receive emails. This includes:

- **Hard bounces** - Invalid addresses
- **Spam complaints** - Recipients who marked you as spam
- **Unsubscribes** - Recipients who opted out
- **Manual additions** - Addresses you've blocked

## Why Suppressions Matter

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Protect Sender Reputation">
    Sending to invalid addresses hurts deliverability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legal Compliance">
    Honoring unsubscribes is required by law (CAN-SPAM, GDPR).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reduce Costs">
    Don't waste sends on addresses that won't receive them.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Automatic Suppressions

Lettr automatically suppresses addresses when:

| Event | Suppression Type | Duration |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Hard bounce | Permanent | Forever |
| Spam complaint | Permanent | Forever |
| Unsubscribe | Permanent | Until removed |
| Soft bounce (3x) | Temporary | 72 hours |

## View Suppressions

```javascript
const suppressions = await lettr.suppressions.list({
  type: 'hard_bounce',
  limit: 100
});

suppressions.forEach(s => {
  console.log({
    email: s.email,
    type: s.type,
    reason: s.reason,
    suppressedAt: s.createdAt
  });
});
```

## Check If Suppressed

```javascript
const check = await lettr.suppressions.check('user@example.com');

if (check.suppressed) {
  console.log(`Suppressed: ${check.type} - ${check.reason}`);
} else {
  console.log('Email is not suppressed');
}
```

## What Happens When You Send to Suppressed Addresses?

The email is silently dropped and counted as suppressed:

```javascript
const result = await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['suppressed@example.com'],
  subject: 'Hello',
  html: '<p>Hello!</p>'
});

// Returns:
{
  "id": "email_123",
  "status": "suppressed",
  "suppressionReason": "hard_bounce"
}
```
