# Billing

Lettr uses a tiered subscription model with calendar-month billing. Each tier includes a base number of emails per month, and additional emails beyond your limit are charged at a flat overage rate. All subscriptions renew on the 1st of each month.

## Plans

Lettr offers a free tier for testing and development, plus six Pro tiers for production use:

### Free Tier

All teams without an active subscription receive **3,000 emails per month** at no cost. This is ideal for testing, development, and low-volume applications. If you exceed the free tier limit, overage charges apply.

### Pro Tiers

| Tier | Emails/Month | Price/Month |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 50K | 50,000 | $15 |
| 100K | 100,000 | $30 |
| 200K | 200,000 | $60 |
| 500K | 500,000 | $150 |
| 1M | 1,000,000 | $300 |
| 2M | 2,000,000 | $500 |

All Pro tiers include:
- Unlimited sending domains
- Unlimited team members
- 30-day log retention
- Email support
- 99.9% uptime SLA

### Overage Pricing

Emails sent beyond your tier limit are charged at **$0.80 per 1,000 emails**, rounded up to the nearest thousand.

## How Billing Works

Lettr uses calendar-month billing cycles, meaning all subscriptions are aligned to the 1st of each month regardless of when you signed up.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Subscribe Mid-Month">
    When you subscribe, you're charged a prorated amount for the remainder of the current month. For example, signing up on January 15th charges roughly half the monthly rate for January.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly Renewal">
    On the 1st of each month, your subscription renews and you're charged the full tier price. Your email counter resets to zero.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Overage Reporting">
    Shortly before your invoice finalizes, Lettr calculates any overage emails (emails sent beyond your tier limit) and adds the overage charge to your invoice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invoice Issued">
    Your invoice includes the tier subscription fee plus any overage charges from the previous period. Invoices are available in your dashboard and via email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Upgrading Your Tier

When you upgrade to a higher tier mid-month, you receive a prorated credit for your current tier and are charged a prorated amount for the new tier. The change takes effect immediately, and your new email limit applies for the remainder of the billing period.

### Downgrading Your Tier

Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period. You retain your current tier's limits until the 1st of the next month, when the new tier becomes active. No prorations are applied for downgrades.

- Managing tax IDs (VAT numbers)

## Invoices

Invoices are generated monthly on the 1st and include:
- **Subscription fee**: Your tier's monthly price
- **Overage charges**: Any emails sent beyond your limit in the previous period
- **Taxes**: Automatically calculated based on your billing address

### Tax Handling

| Non-EU | No tax |

<Tip>
  Add your VAT ID in the Stripe billing portal to enable reverse charge for EU business customers.
</Tip>

## Usage Tracking

Email usage is tracked in real-time. Your counter resets to zero on the 1st of each month when your subscription renews.

### What Counts as Usage

Each email sent through the API counts as one email toward your limit, regardless of:
- Number of recipients (each recipient = 1 email)
- Email size
- Whether tracking is enabled

Emails that fail validation before being queued do not count toward your limit. Emails that bounce after delivery do count.

### Usage Alerts

Set up alerts to notify you when approaching your limit:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Configure usage threshold alerts (e.g., 80%, 90%)
3. Add notification email addresses

## Cancel Subscription

To cancel your subscription:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Manage Subscription**
3. Select **Cancel subscription** in the Stripe portal

<Note>
  Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You retain full access and your current email limit until then. After cancellation, your team reverts to the free tier (3,000 emails/month).
