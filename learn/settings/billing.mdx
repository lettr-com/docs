Lettr uses a tiered subscription model with calendar-month billing. Each tier includes a monthly email allowance, and emails beyond that allowance are billed at a flat overage rate. All subscriptions renew on the 1st of each month.

## Plans

Lettr offers a free tier for testing and development, plus five Pro tiers and custom enterprise pricing for production use.

### Free Tier

All teams without an active subscription receive **3,000 emails per month** at no cost, with a **100 emails per day** limit. The free tier includes 1 sending domain, basic analytics, and 7-day data retention. This is ideal for testing, development, and low-volume applications.

### Pro Tiers

| Tier | Emails/Month | Sending Domains | Price/Month |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 50K | 50,000 | 10 | $15 |
| 100K | 100,000 | 10 | $30 |
| 200K | 200,000 | Unlimited | $110 |
| 500K | 500,000 | Unlimited | $250 |
| 1M | 1,000,000 | Unlimited | $450 |
| 2M+ | 2,000,000+ | Unlimited | Custom |

All Pro tiers include:
- **Sending domains**: 10 for 50K and 100K; unlimited for 200K and above
- No daily sending limit
- Unlimited team members
- Advanced analytics
- 30-day data retention
- Priority support

<Tip>
  For the 2M+ tier, [contact sales](mailto:sales@lettr.com) for custom pricing based on your volume needs.
</Tip>

### Overage Pricing

Emails sent beyond your tier limit are charged at **$0.80 per 1,000 emails**, rounded up to the nearest thousand. Overage is calculated and reported to Stripe automatically throughout your billing period. For the 2M+ tier, contact us for custom overage pricing.

  <Accordion title="Overage calculation examples">
    - **1,500 overage emails**: Rounded up to 2,000 → $1.60
    - **10,001 overage emails**: Rounded up to 11,000 → $8.80
    - **1 overage email**: Rounded up to 1,000 → $0.80

## How Billing Works

All subscriptions use calendar-month billing cycles — they are aligned to the 1st of each month regardless of when you signed up.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Subscribe">
    When you subscribe mid-month, you are charged a prorated amount for the remainder of the current month. For example, signing up on January 15th charges roughly half the monthly rate for January.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly Renewal">
    On the 1st of each month, your subscription renews at the full tier price and your email counter resets to zero.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Overage Billing">
    Overage emails (emails sent beyond your tier limit) are tracked in real-time and reported to Stripe throughout the billing period. The overage charge appears on your next invoice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invoice Issued">
    Your invoice includes the tier subscription fee plus any overage charges from the previous period. Invoices are available in your dashboard and sent via email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Upgrading

When you upgrade to a higher tier mid-month, you receive a prorated credit for your current tier and are charged a prorated amount for the new tier. The change takes effect immediately and your new email limit applies for the remainder of the billing period.

### Downgrading

Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period. You keep your current tier's limits until the 1st of the next month, when the lower tier becomes active. No prorations are applied for downgrades.

## Manage Your Plan

Check your current subscription and usage at **Settings** → **Billing**.

The billing page displays:
- **Current tier** and monthly price
- **Emails sent** this billing period
- **Email limit** for your current tier
- **Overage emails** sent beyond your limit (if any)
- **Days remaining** in the current billing period

### Upgrade

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Upgrade Plan**
3. Select your new tier
4. Confirm the prorated charge

Your new email limit applies immediately.

### Downgrade

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Change Plan**
3. Select a lower tier
4. Confirm the change

The downgrade takes effect on the 1st of next month.

## Payment Methods

Lettr accepts all major credit cards via Stripe. Payment methods are managed through the Stripe billing portal.

### Add or Update Payment Method

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Manage Subscription** to open the Stripe portal
3. Select **Payment methods**
4. Add a new card or update your default

### Billing Portal

Access the full Stripe billing portal from **Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage Subscription** for:
- Updating payment methods
- Viewing and downloading invoices
- Updating billing address
- Managing tax IDs (VAT numbers)

## Invoices

Invoices are generated monthly on the 1st and include:
- **Subscription fee**: Your tier's monthly price
- **Overage charges**: Any emails sent beyond your limit in the previous period
- **Taxes**: Automatically calculated based on your billing address

### View Invoices

| Non-EU | No tax |

<Tip>

</Tip>

## Usage Tracking

Email usage is tracked in real-time. Your counter resets to zero on the 1st of each month when your subscription renews.

### What Counts as Usage

Each recipient on each API request counts as one email toward your limit:
- Sending to 3 `to` addresses and 2 `cc` addresses counts as 5 emails
- Email size, content type, and tracking settings do not affect the count

Emails that fail validation before being queued do **not** count toward your limit. Emails that bounce after delivery **do** count.

### Usage Alerts

Set up alerts to notify you when approaching your limit:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Configure usage threshold alerts (e.g., 80%, 90%)
3. Add notification email addresses

## Cancel Subscription

To cancel your subscription:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Manage Subscription**
3. Select **Cancel subscription** in the Stripe portal

<Note>
  Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You retain full access and your current email limit until then. After cancellation, your team reverts to the free tier (3,000 emails/month, 100/day limit).
</Note>

If you change your mind before the billing period ends, you can resume your subscription from the same page. Resuming keeps your current tier and prevents the downgrade to the free tier.
