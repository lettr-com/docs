# Onboarding

When you first create a Lettr account, you'll be guided through a 4-step onboarding wizard to set up your team. This process helps Lettr configure the right defaults for your email infrastructure.

## Onboarding Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Company Basics">
    Enter your **company name**, **website**, and **business type**. If you provide a website URL, Lettr automatically fetches your company logo and other details in the background.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Additional Details">
    Optionally provide your **country**, **timezone**, **number of employees**, and **your role**. This helps Lettr tailor recommendations for your team. All fields in this step are optional.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Company Information">
    Review and confirm your **company logo** (auto-fetched from your website if available), and optionally add URLs for your **Terms of Use** and **Privacy Policy**. These can be included in email templates later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email Template Style">
    Browse and select an **email template style** that matches your brand. Lettr uses this to populate your default project with premade templates in your chosen style, giving you a head start on template creation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can skip steps 2–4 by clicking **Skip & Complete** if you want to get started immediately. You can always update these settings later in your team settings.
</Tip>

## What Happens After Onboarding

Once you complete the wizard:

- A **default project** is created for your team with folders organized by email type
- **Premade templates** matching your selected style are added to your project
- Your team is ready to configure domains, create API keys, and start sending
