# Profile & Appearance

Your profile and appearance settings are personal to your account and apply across all teams you belong to.

## Profile Settings

Update your personal information from **Settings** → **Profile**.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Your display name shown to team members and in email notifications |
| **Email** | Your login email address (must be unique across all Lettr accounts) |

Changes take effect immediately after saving.

## Appearance

Customize the Lettr dashboard appearance from **Settings** → **Appearance**.

Lettr supports three theme modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **System** | Automatically matches your operating system's light or dark mode preference (default) |
| **Light** | Always uses the light theme |
| **Dark** | Always uses the dark theme |

Your appearance preference is stored in your browser and persists across sessions.

## Password

Change your account password from **Settings** → **Password**. You'll need to enter your current password and your new password.

<Tip>
  For stronger account security, enable [two-factor authentication](/learn/settings/security) in addition to using a strong password.
</Tip>

## What's Shared vs. Personal

| Setting | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| Name, email, password | Personal — applies to your account across all teams |
| Appearance (theme) | Personal — stored per browser |
| Two-factor authentication | Personal — protects your account on all teams |
| Team name, domains, billing | Per team — managed in team settings |
