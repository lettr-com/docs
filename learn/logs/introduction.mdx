description: "View and troubleshoot API requests in the Lettr Dashboard"
---

The Logs page provides detailed information about every API request made to Lettr, helping you monitor activity, debug integrations, and troubleshoot issues quickly.

## Overview

Access your logs from the [Logs page](https://app.lettr.com/logs) in the dashboard. The API Logs view shows a comprehensive table of all API requests with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Timestamp** | When the request was made |
| **Method** | The HTTP method used (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.) |
| **Path** | The API endpoint called (e.g., `api/emails`, `api/domains`) |
| **Status** | The HTTP response status code |
| **IP Address** | The IP address that made the request |
| **API Key** | Which API key was used (if applicable) |
| **Details** | Click to view full request and response details |

<Info>
  API logs are retained for **30 days**. After this period, logs are automatically deleted.
</Info>

## Filtering Logs

Use the filter controls at the top of the page to narrow down your search.

### Date Range

Select a custom date range to view logs from a specific period. The default view shows the last 7 days.

### API Keys

Filter logs by specific API key to see requests made by a particular integration:

- **All API Keys** - View logs from all API keys
- **Specific key** - Select a named API key to filter

This is useful when debugging a specific integration or tracking usage per application.

### User Agents

Filter by the SDK or client used to make requests:

| User Agent | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **SMTP** | Requests via SMTP relay |
| **Node.js** | Lettr Node.js SDK |
| **PHP** | Lettr PHP SDK |
| **Python** | Lettr Python SDK |
| **Ruby** | Lettr Ruby SDK |
| **Go** | Lettr Go SDK |
| **Rust** | Lettr Rust SDK |
| **Java** | Lettr Java SDK |
| **.NET** | Lettr .NET SDK |
| **cURL** | Direct cURL requests |
| **Other** | Other HTTP clients |

### Status Codes

Filter by HTTP response status to quickly identify successful requests or errors:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **All Statuses** | Show all requests |
| **200 - Ok** | Successful GET requests |
| **201 - Created** | Successful POST requests (resource created) |
| **400 - Bad Request** | Invalid request format or parameters |
| **401 - Unauthorized** | Missing or invalid API key |
| **403 - Forbidden** | API key lacks required permissions |
| **404 - Not Found** | Requested resource doesn't exist |
| **422 - Unprocessable Content** | Request validation failed |
| **429 - Too Many Requests** | Rate limit exceeded |
| **451 - Unavailable For Legal Reasons** | Content blocked for legal compliance |
| **500 - Internal Server Error** | Server-side error |

<Tip>
  To quickly find failed requests, filter by 4xx and 5xx status codes. This helps you identify integration issues that need attention.
</Tip>

## Searching Logs

Click the **Search** button after applying filters to refresh the results. The search respects all active filters including date range, API key, user agent, and status code selections.

## Log Details

Click the details icon (or anywhere on a row) to open the full log detail view for any request.

### Request Information

The detail view shows:

- **Method & Path** - The HTTP method and API endpoint (e.g., `POST api/emails`)
- **Status Code** - The response status with color indicator (green for success, red for errors)
- **Timestamp** - Exact date and time of the request
- **Request Body** - The full JSON payload sent to the API

**Example request body:**

```json
{
  "from": "sender@example.com",
  "to": [
    "recipient@example.com"
  ],
  "subject": "Test send",
  "text": "Plain-text body",
  "html": "<p>HTML body</p> And click here: <a href=\"https://example.com\">Link</a>"
}
```

### Response Information

- **Response Body** - The complete API response

**Example response body:**

```json
{
  "message": "Email queued for delivery.",
  "data": {
    "request_id": "759976368330071843",
    "accepted": 1,
    "rejected": 0
  }
}
```

### Metadata

Additional information about the request:

- **IP Address** - The source IP address
- **API Key** - The API key name used (with the key itself partially masked for security)
- **User Agent** - The client or SDK used (e.g., `bruno-runtime/3.0.2`, `lettr-node/1.0.0`)

## Truncated Fields

To optimize storage and display, some large fields are truncated in the logs:

| Field | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **HTML body** | Truncated after 1,000 characters |
| **Plain text body** | Truncated after 1,000 characters |
| **AMP HTML body** | Truncated after 1,000 characters |
| **Attachments** | File metadata shown, content not stored |
| **Recipient Metadata** | Truncated for large recipient lists |

<Note>
  Truncation only affects log display. The actual email sent contains the full content.
</Note>

## Common Status Codes

### Success Codes

| Code | Meaning | Typical Cause |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 200 | OK | GET request successful |
| 201 | Created | POST request successful, resource created |

### Client Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | How to Fix |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Check request body format and required fields |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Verify your API key is correct and active |
| 403 | Forbidden | Check API key permissions for this endpoint |
| 404 | Not Found | Verify the resource ID exists |
| 422 | Unprocessable | Check validation errors in response body |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Implement rate limiting, wait before retrying |
| 451 | Legal Block | Content flagged for compliance reasons |

### Server Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | What to Do |
|------|---------|------------|
| 500 | Internal Error | Retry the request; contact support if persistent |

## Troubleshooting with Logs

### Finding Failed Requests

1. Set the **Status** filter to show only error codes (4xx, 5xx)
2. Click **Search** to filter results
3. Click on a failed request to view details
4. Check the **Response Body** for error messages

### Debugging a Specific Integration

1. Filter by the **API Key** used by that integration
2. Optionally filter by **User Agent** if using an SDK
3. Review recent requests for patterns or errors

### Tracking Rate Limit Issues

1. Filter by status code **429 - Too Many Requests**
2. Note the timestamps to identify when limits are being hit
3. Review the IP addresses to see if requests are distributed
4. Implement exponential backoff in your integration

## Best Practices

### Monitor Regularly

Check your API logs periodically to catch issues early:

- **Watch for error patterns** — A sudden spike in 422 or 401 errors often indicates a configuration change or integration bug
- **Set up alerting** — Use webhook-based alerting so your team is notified when error rates exceed a threshold
- **Monitor rate limits** — Pay particular attention to 429 errors, which may signal that your integration needs pacing improvements or a plan upgrade

### Use Descriptive API Key Names

Name your API keys descriptively (e.g., "Production Server", "Staging Environment", "Marketing Integration") to easily identify which system made each request.

### Correlate with Email Events

When troubleshooting email delivery issues:

1. Find the send request in logs using the timestamp
2. Note the `request_id` from the response
3. Use this ID to track the email in the Emails dashboard
