description: "HTTP status codes returned by the Lettr API and how to interpret them"
---

The Lettr API uses standard HTTP status codes in every response. When viewing [API Logs](https://app.lettr.com/logs), you can filter by status code to quickly find successful requests or errors.

## Success (2xx)

| Code | Name | When you'll see it |
|------|------|--------------------|
| **200** | OK | Successful GET, PATCH, or DELETE requests. The response body contains the requested or updated resource. |
| **201** | Created | Successful POST requests that create a resource (e.g. sending an email, creating a domain). The response body contains the new resource. |
| **204** | No Content | Successful DELETE requests with no response body. |

## Client errors (4xx)

These indicate a problem with the request (missing or invalid API key, bad parameters, or missing resource).

| Code | Name | Cause | What to do |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| **400** | Bad Request | Invalid request format, malformed JSON, or invalid parameters. | Check the response body for an error message and fix your request. |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Missing API key or invalid API key. | Ensure the `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` header is set with a valid [API key](/learn/api-keys/introduction). |
| **403** | Forbidden | API key is valid but does not have permission for this action. | Use an API key with the required [permissions](/learn/api-keys/permissions) or create a new key. |
| **404** | Not Found | The requested resource does not exist (e.g. wrong domain name, email ID, or template slug). | Verify the ID or identifier in the URL path. |
| **409** | Conflict | Resource already exists or state conflict (e.g. domain already added). | Check the response message; you may need to use a different identifier or update the existing resource. |
| **422** | Unprocessable Content | Request body failed validation (e.g. invalid email address, missing required field). | The response includes an `errors` object with field-level messages. Fix the listed fields and retry. |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded. | Retry after the time indicated in the `Retry-After` header. See [rate limits](/knowledge-base/troubleshooting/rate-limits). |
| **451** | Unavailable For Legal Reasons | Request blocked for legal or compliance reasons. | Contact support if you believe this is in error. |

## Server errors (5xx)

These indicate a temporary problem on Lettr's side. Retrying later usually succeeds.

| Code | Name | When you'll see it |
|------|------|--------------------|
| **500** | Internal Server Error | An unexpected server error occurred. |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | The server received an invalid response from an upstream service. |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | The service is temporarily overloaded or in maintenance. |

<Tip>
  In the [Logs](https://app.lettr.com/logs) dashboard, filter by 4xx or 5xx to quickly find failed requests and debug integration issues.
