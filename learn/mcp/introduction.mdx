title: MCP Introduction
description: "Connect AI assistants to Lettr using the Model Context Protocol"
---

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor to securely connect with external services. Lettr's MCP server allows AI agents to interact programmatically with your email infrastructure—sending messages, monitoring delivery, inspecting events, and troubleshooting issues—all through natural language conversation.

## Why Use MCP?

MCP transforms how you interact with your email infrastructure. Instead of switching between dashboards, writing code, or memorizing API calls, you can simply ask your AI assistant to handle email tasks for you.

| Traditional Workflow | With MCP |
|---------------------|----------|
| Open dashboard, navigate to domains, check verification status | "Check if my domain example.com is verified" |
| Write code to send an email via API | "Send a test email to john@example.com" |
| Query API logs, parse response, identify issues | "Why didn't my email to jane@example.com deliver yesterday?" |
| Browse events, filter by recipient, analyze patterns | "Show me recent bounces for the last 24 hours" |

## What Can You Do with Lettr MCP?

The Lettr MCP server provides AI assistants with a comprehensive set of tools to manage your email infrastructure.

### Send Emails

Your AI assistant can compose and send emails through natural language:

- **Compose directly** — Dictate content, specifying recipients, subject lines, and body text in conversation
- **Use templates** — Reference pre-built templates and let the AI populate merge tags with personalization data using the `{{variable_name}}` syntax
- **Full options** — CC, BCC, reply-to addresses, attachments, and tracking settings are all available

<Note>
  AI assistants send emails on your behalf using your verified sending domains. The same domain verification requirements apply as with the REST API.
</Note>

### Monitor Email Events

Once emails are sent, you can ask your AI assistant to track what happens next. The event monitoring tools provide visibility into:

- **Delivery status** — Successful deliveries, bounces, and deferrals
- **Engagement metrics** — Opens, clicks, and unsubscribes
- **Compliance events** — Spam complaints
- **Filtering** — Filter by recipient address, date range, or event type to find exactly what you're looking for

### Inspect API Activity

When debugging integration issues, your AI assistant can review API request logs on your behalf:

- **Request/response payloads** — Examine payloads (truncated for large responses)
- **Status codes and errors** — HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Client details** — Client IP addresses and API key prefixes used for each request
- **Filtering** — Narrow down problems by date range, API key name, client type, or status code

### Manage Domains

Your AI assistant can check the status of all domain types in your email infrastructure:

- **Sending domains** — DKIM and SPF verification status
- **Tracking domains** — Branded click and open links
- **Inbound domains** — Email receiving configuration
- **Storage domains** — Asset CDN configuration

Ask about specific domains or request an overview of your entire setup.

### View Configuration

Beyond domains, the AI can inspect your broader account configuration:

- **API keys** — List keys showing prefixes only (never full values) for security
- **Webhook endpoints** — Review endpoints with their enabled event types and delivery health indicators

## Supported AI Clients

Lettr's MCP server works with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol:

| Client | Support |
|--------|---------|
| Claude (claude.ai) | Supported |
| ChatGPT | Supported |
| Cursor IDE | Supported |
| GitHub Copilot | Supported |

<Tip>
  MCP uses OAuth 2.1 for authentication. When you connect an AI client, you'll authorize it through Lettr's secure OAuth flow—your API keys are never shared with the AI assistant.
</Tip>

## Security Considerations

The MCP integration is designed with security as a foundational principle:

- **OAuth authentication** — AI clients authenticate through Lettr's OAuth flow rather than using API keys directly, so your credentials are never exposed to the AI assistant
- **Session-tied access** — Access is tied to your active Lettr session — when you sign out, the AI loses access automatically
- **Team-scoped permissions** — AI assistants can only access data and perform actions within the boundaries of your existing Lettr permissions
- **Key masking** — When the AI lists API keys, it only sees prefixes — never full key values — protecting your credentials even within the MCP context
- **Rate limiting** — All MCP requests follow the same rate limits as the REST API, preventing abuse

<Warning>
  MCP allows AI assistants to send emails on your behalf. Only connect trusted AI clients and review actions before confirming sensitive operations.
</Warning>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your AI Client">
    Configure your AI assistant to connect to `https://app.lettr.com/mcp` as an MCP server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate via OAuth">
    When prompted, sign in to Lettr and authorize the AI client to access your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Interacting">
    Ask your AI assistant to perform email tasks using natural language.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Confirm">
    The AI presents its intended actions. Confirm before executing sensitive operations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Conversations

Once connected, you can interact with your email infrastructure using natural language. Here are some examples:

**Sending emails:**
> "Send an email to john@example.com from hello@mycompany.com about tomorrow's 3pm meeting"

**Debugging delivery:**
> "Why didn't my message to jane@example.com deliver yesterday?"

**Checking domains:**
> "Is my domain notifications.example.com verified and ready to send?"

**Reviewing events:**
> "Show me all bounces from the last week for emails sent from marketing@example.com"

**Inspecting API usage:**
> "What API requests failed with 4xx errors today?"

## Technical Details

For developers interested in the implementation:

- **Server URL** — `https://app.lettr.com/mcp`
- **Authentication** — OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration
- **Discovery endpoints** — `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- **Pagination** — Cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- **Rate limits** — Same rate limits as the REST API
