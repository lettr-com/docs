# Rate Limits

Lettr enforces rate limits on API requests and monthly email quotas on sending volume. Rate limits prevent any single integration from overwhelming the service, while monthly quotas govern how many emails your plan allows. Understanding these limits helps you design integrations that send reliably without hitting throttling errors.

## API Rate Limits

Lettr applies per-account rate limits based on a sliding window. If you exceed the limit, subsequent requests return a `429` status until the window resets:

| Limit Type | Value | Window |
|------------|-------|--------|
| API requests | 300 requests | 5 minutes |
| High-volume API | 2,000 requests | 5 minutes |
| Authentication failures | 5 failures | 5 minutes (15 min block) |

## Email Sending Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Recipients per request | 50 (combined to, cc, bcc) |
| Monthly email quota | Based on your plan |

## Rate Limit Response

When you exceed rate limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests. Please retry after 60 seconds.",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

## Handling Rate Limits

When you receive a `429` response, the `retry_after` field tells you how many seconds to wait before retrying. Implement exponential backoff as a fallback when the header is missing:

```javascript
async function sendWithBackoff(emailData, maxRetries = 5) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await lettr.emails.send(emailData);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.status === 429) {
        const retryAfter = error.retryAfter || Math.pow(2, attempt);
        console.log(`Rate limited. Retrying in ${retryAfter} seconds...`);
        await sleep(retryAfter * 1000);
      } else {
        throw error;
      }
    }
  }
  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
}
```

## Batch Sending with Rate Limiting

When sending to large recipient lists, pace your API calls to stay within rate limits. Adding a short delay between batches prevents bursts that trigger throttling:

```javascript
const recipients = [...]; // Large list
const batchSize = 50;
const delayBetweenBatches = 200; // milliseconds

for (let i = 0; i < recipients.length; i += batchSize) {
  const batch = recipients.slice(i, i + batchSize);

  await lettr.emails.send({
    from: 'you@example.com',
    to: batch,
    subject: 'Newsletter',
    html: content
  });

  // Pace your requests
  if (i + batchSize < recipients.length) {
    await sleep(delayBetweenBatches);
  }
}
```

## Monthly Email Quotas

Your monthly email quota depends on your plan:

| Plan | Monthly Emails |
|------|----------------|
| Free | 3,000 |
| Pro 50K | 50,000 |
| Pro 100K | 100,000 |
| Pro 200K | 200,000 |
| Pro 500K | 500,000 |
| Pro 1M | 1,000,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

<Note>
  Emails beyond your tier limit are charged at $0.80 per 1,000 emails. See [Billing](/learn/settings/billing) for details.
</Note>

## Checking Your Usage

Monitor your email usage via the dashboard or API:

```javascript
const usage = await lettr.usage.get();

console.log({
  sent: usage.emailsSent,
  quota: usage.monthlyQuota,
  remaining: usage.monthlyQuota - usage.emailsSent,
  percentUsed: (usage.emailsSent / usage.monthlyQuota) * 100
});
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement Backoff">
    Always implement exponential backoff for `429` responses. Use the `retry_after` value from the response when available, and fall back to a `2^attempt` delay otherwise. Without backoff, rapid retries will keep hitting the limit and delay your sends further.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Batch Efficiently">
    Each API request supports up to 50 recipients. Sending to 50 recipients per request instead of one-at-a-time reduces your API call count by 50x, making it far easier to stay within rate limits for large sends.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage">
    Check your monthly email usage periodically through the dashboard or API. Set up internal alerts at 80% and 90% of your quota so you can upgrade your plan or adjust sending patterns before hitting the limit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Queue Large Sends">
    For campaigns targeting thousands of recipients, use a job queue (such as BullMQ, Laravel Queues, or Celery) to pace sending over minutes or hours. This avoids burst patterns that trigger rate limits and gives you better control over delivery timing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Webhooks">
    Polling the API to check delivery status consumes rate limit budget. Instead, set up webhooks to receive delivery, bounce, and engagement events asynchronously. This eliminates polling requests entirely and gives you faster, event-driven status updates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Increasing Your Limits

If your current limits don't match your sending volume, you have several options:

- **Upgrade your plan** — Increases your monthly email quota immediately
- **Enterprise plans** — Custom rate limits tailored to your traffic patterns — contact sales to discuss your requirements
- **Batch recipients** — Send up to 50 recipients per request to reduce API call volume
- **Use webhooks** — Replace polling with event-driven notifications to save rate limit budget
- **Implement a queue** — Smooth out traffic spikes to avoid burst patterns
