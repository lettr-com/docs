description: "Group emails for analytics with a single string tag"
---

Tags let you label emails with a single string identifier so you can group and analyze them in the [Analytics dashboard](/learn/analytics/filtering-and-breakdowns). Every email you send can carry one tag (max 64 characters), and you can then filter and break down metrics — sent, delivered, bounced, opened, clicked — by that tag.

## Adding a Tag via API

Include the `tag` field in your send request:

```json
POST /api/emails
Authorization: Bearer lttr_xxxxxxxxxxxx

{
  "from": "marketing@yourdomain.com",
  "to": ["subscriber@example.com"],
  "subject": "Weekly Newsletter",
  "html": "<p>This week's update...</p>",
  "tag": "welcome"
}
```

## Adding a Tag via PHP SDK

Use the `->tag()` method on the email builder:

```php
$response = $lettr->emails()->send(
    $lettr->emails()->create()
        ->from('marketing@yourdomain.com')
        ->to(['subscriber@example.com'])
        ->subject('Weekly Newsletter')
        ->html('<p>This week\'s update...</p>')
        ->tag('welcome')
);
```

## Automatic Tags from Templates

When you send an email using a `template_slug`, Lettr automatically sets the tag to the template slug on the server. You don't need to pass a `tag` yourself — your analytics are grouped by template out of the box.

This also means that each template in the Emails dashboard shows **Sent**, **Opened**, and **Rate** columns, giving you per-template engagement stats without any extra configuration.

<Tip>
  You can still override the automatic tag by passing an explicit `tag` in the request. The explicit tag takes priority.
</Tip>

## Tags in the Dashboard

Tags appear in two places in the Lettr dashboard:

### Analytics by Tag

The home dashboard includes an **Analytics by Tag** widget that shows sending stats for the last 30 days grouped by tag — Sent, Opened, and Rate at a glance.

### Analytics Filtering and Breakdowns

On the Analytics page you can use tags in two ways:

- **Filter by Tag** — Show only data for emails with a specific tag. Open the Configure modal, go to the Filters tab, and select "Tag" as the filter type.
- **Break down by Tag** — Use the "Break Down By" dropdown below the chart to see your metrics split by tag. This lets you compare performance across different email categories at a glance.

See [Filtering and Breakdowns](/learn/analytics/filtering-and-breakdowns) for full details on the Configure modal.

## Tag Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Maximum length | 64 characters |
| Tags per email | One |
| Format | Plain string — letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores |

## Metadata vs Tags

Tags and [metadata](/learn/sending/metadata) serve different purposes:

| | Tags | Metadata |
|---|------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Analytics grouping | Per-email tracking data |
| **Structure** | Single string | Key-value pairs |
| **Where it appears** | Analytics dashboard filters and breakdowns | Webhooks, API queries, dashboard |
| **Best for** | Comparing performance across email categories | Linking emails to orders, customers, or internal IDs |

Use a tag when you want to group emails in the Analytics dashboard (e.g., `welcome-series`, `order-confirmation`). Use metadata when you need to attach structured data for webhooks or API queries (e.g., `orderId`, `customerId`).
