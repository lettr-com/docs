# Email Tracking

Track email engagement with open and click tracking to measure the effectiveness of your emails.

## Default Tracking

By default, Lettr tracks opens and clicks for all emails:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Newsletter',
  html: '<p>Check out our <a href="https://example.com">website</a>!</p>'
  // Open and click tracking enabled by default
});
```

## Customize Tracking Options

Enable or disable tracking per email:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Private Message',
  html: '<p>This is a private message.</p>',
  options: {
    open_tracking: false,
    click_tracking: false
  }
});
```

## How Open Tracking Works

Lettr inserts a tiny invisible image (tracking pixel) into your HTML emails. When the recipient's email client loads images, the open is recorded.

<Note>
  Open tracking requires HTML content. Plain text emails cannot be tracked for opens. Some email clients block images by default, which may result in under-reported open rates.
</Note>

## How Click Tracking Works

Lettr rewrites links in your email to route through our tracking servers. When a recipient clicks a link:

1. The click is recorded with timestamp and link URL
2. The recipient is immediately redirected to the original destination

```html
<!-- Original link in your email -->
<a href="https://example.com/product">View Product</a>

<!-- Becomes (with click tracking enabled) -->
<a href="https://track.lettr.com/c/abc123">View Product</a>
```

## Custom Tracking Domain

Use your own domain for tracking links instead of the default Lettr domain:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Newsletter',
  html: '<p>Click <a href="https://example.com">here</a>!</p>',
  options: {
    click_tracking: true
  }
});
```

Links will use your configured tracking domain (e.g., `track.yourdomain.com`) if set up in your domain settings.

## Transactional Flag

Mark emails as transactional for better deliverability:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Password Reset',
  html: '<p>Click here to reset your password...</p>',
  options: {
    transactional: true  // Default is true
  }
});
```

<Tip>
  Transactional emails (password resets, order confirmations) typically have higher deliverability than marketing emails.
</Tip>

## Tracking Options Reference

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `open_tracking` | boolean | `true` | Track when emails are opened |
| `click_tracking` | boolean | `true` | Track when links are clicked |
| `transactional` | boolean | `true` | Mark as transactional email |

## Privacy Considerations

Respect user privacy by disabling tracking when appropriate:

```javascript
// For privacy-sensitive emails
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['privacy-conscious@example.com'],
  subject: 'Your Data Export',
  html: '<p>Here is your requested data export.</p>',
  options: {
    open_tracking: false,
    click_tracking: false
  }
});
```

## Viewing Tracking Data

Access tracking data via the API or dashboard:

```javascript
// Get email with tracking stats
const email = await lettr.emails.get('email_123');

console.log({
  opens: email.opens,
  clicks: email.clicks,
  firstOpenedAt: email.firstOpenedAt,
  lastOpenedAt: email.lastOpenedAt
});
```
