# Postponed Sending

Schedule emails to be delivered at a specific date and time.

## Schedule an Email

Use the `scheduledAt` parameter with an ISO 8601 timestamp:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Scheduled Reminder',
  html: '<p>This is your scheduled reminder!</p>',
  scheduledAt: '2024-12-25T09:00:00Z'
});
```

## Response

Scheduled emails return a `scheduled` status:

```json
{
  "id": "email_123abc",
  "status": "scheduled",
  "scheduledAt": "2024-12-25T09:00:00Z",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Cancel a Scheduled Email

Cancel before it's sent:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.cancel('email_123abc');
```

## Reschedule an Email

Update the scheduled time:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.update('email_123abc', {
  scheduledAt: '2024-12-26T09:00:00Z'
});
```

## Timezone Handling

Always use UTC times with the `Z` suffix:

```javascript
// Convert local time to UTC
const localDate = new Date('2024-12-25T09:00:00');
const utcString = localDate.toISOString();

await lettr.emails.send({
  // ...
  scheduledAt: utcString
});
```

## Scheduling Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Maximum schedule time | 30 days in advance |
| Minimum schedule time | 1 minute from now |

<Note>
  Emails scheduled more than 30 days in advance will be rejected. For longer delays, consider using a job scheduler like cron or your application's queue system.
