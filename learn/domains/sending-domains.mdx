# Sending Domains

A sending domain is the domain you use in the "From" address of your emails, such as `yourcompany.com` in `hello@yourcompany.com`. Configuring a sending domain allows you to authenticate your emails with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, which tells email providers that Lettr is authorized to send on your behalf. This authentication is essential for reaching inboxes instead of spam folders, building brand trust, and maintaining a positive sender reputation over time.

## Why Use a Sending Domain?

- **Better Deliverability** - Authenticated emails are less likely to be marked as spam
- **Brand Recognition** - Recipients see your domain, not a generic sender
- **Reputation Building** - Build and maintain your own sender reputation
- **DMARC Compliance** - Required for advanced email security features like BIMI

## Adding a Sending Domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add domain in Dashboard">
    Go to **Domains → Sending Domains** and click **+ New Sending Domain**. Enter your domain name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure DNS Records">
    Add the required DNS records (see table below—root domains need SPF, DKIM, DMARC; subdomains need DKIM, DMARC, and Bounce CNAME only).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Domain">
    Click **Verify** to confirm DNS propagation. Verification typically takes a few minutes but can take up to 48 hours.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Via API

Create a sending domain with `POST /domains`. The request body contains only the domain name:

### Via Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Domains">
    Go to **Domains** → **Sending** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Domain">
    Click **Add Domain** and enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy DNS Records">
    Copy the provided DNS records. You'll need to add these to your DNS provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Add the SPF, DKIM, CNAME, and DMARC records to your domain's DNS settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Domain">
    Return to Lettr and click **Verify** to check your DNS configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via API

Create a sending domain:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/domains \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain": "example.com"
  }'
```

Response with DNS records to configure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "domain": "example.com",
    "status": "pending",
    "status_label": "Pending Review",
    "dkim": {
      "selector": "scph0722",
      "public": "MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQ..."
    }
  }
}
```

## DNS Records Configuration

After adding your domain, configure these DNS records with your DNS provider:

### CNAME Record (Domain Verification)

The CNAME record verifies domain ownership and enables bounce handling.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | CNAME |
| Host/Name | `@` (root domain) |
| Value | `sparkpostmail.com` |

### DKIM Record

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) enables email signing to verify message authenticity.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | TXT |
| Host/Name | `{selector}._domainkey` (selector provided by Lettr) |
| Value | `v=DKIM1; k=rsa; h=sha256; p=...` (provided by Lettr) |

<Note>
  The DKIM selector and public key are unique to your domain and will be provided when you add your domain. The selector might look like `scph0722`, so your full hostname would be `scph0722._domainkey.example.com`. Copy the values exactly as shown.
</Note>

### DMARC Record

DMARC ties together SPF and DKIM to protect against spoofing. Start with a monitoring policy:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | TXT |
| Host/Name | `_dmarc` |
| Value | `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com` |

<Tip>
  See our [DMARC guide](/learn/domains/dmarc) for recommended rollout strategies and policy options.
</Tip>

## Verifying Your Domain

After configuring DNS records, verify your domain:

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Domains** → **Sending**
2. Find your domain and click **Verify**
3. Wait for verification to complete (usually within a few minutes)

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/example.com/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "domain": "example.com",
    "dkim_status": "valid",
    "cname_status": "valid",
    "dmarc_status": "valid",
    "ownership_verified": "example.com"
  }
}
```

## Domain Status

### Verification Status

Each DNS record has its own verification status:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `valid` | Record found and valid |
| `unverified` | Record not yet detected |
| `invalid` | Record found but invalid |
| `missing` | No record found (DMARC only) |

### Approval Status

Sending domains also have an approval status that determines whether you can send emails:

| Status | Description | Can Send? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `approved` | Domain approved for sending | Yes |
| `pending` | Under review | No |
| `blocked` | Domain blocked | No |

<Note>
  Lettr automatically evaluates new domains for approval based on domain age, reputation, and other factors. Most legitimate business domains are approved automatically.
</Note>

## Check Domain Status

### Via API

```bash
curl https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "domain": "example.com",
    "status": "approved",
    "status_label": "Approved",
    "can_send": true,
    "dkim_status": "valid",
    "cname_status": "valid",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Sending Emails from Your Domain

Once verified, you can send emails from any address on your domain:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "hello@example.com",
    "to": ["recipient@other.com"],
    "subject": "Welcome!",
    "html": "<p>Thanks for signing up!</p>"
  }'
```

### Using a From Name

Customize the sender display name:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "hello@example.com",
    "from_name": "Your Company",
    "to": ["recipient@other.com"],
    "subject": "Welcome!",
    "html": "<p>Thanks for signing up!</p>"
  }'
```

This appears in email clients as: **Your Company** `<hello@example.com>`

## Multiple Sending Domains

You can verify multiple domains for different purposes:

| Domain | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `yourcompany.com` | General business communications |
| `mail.yourcompany.com` | Marketing and newsletters |
| `notifications.yourcompany.com` | Automated transactional emails |
| `support.yourcompany.com` | Customer support communications |

<Tip>
  Using subdomains for different email types helps isolate reputation. If marketing emails generate complaints, your transactional email reputation remains protected.
</Tip>

## Associating a Tracking Domain

Link a [tracking domain](/learn/domains/tracking-domains) to your sending domain for branded tracking links:

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Domains** → **Sending**
2. Select your sending domain
3. Under **Tracking Domain**, select or add a tracking domain

### Via API

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tracking_domain": "links.example.com"
  }'
```

## List All Sending Domains

```bash
curl https://app.lettr.com/api/domains \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "domains": [
      {
        "domain": "example.com",
        "status": "approved",
        "status_label": "Approved",
        "can_send": true,
        "dkim_status": "valid",
        "cname_status": "valid",
        "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"
      },
      {
        "domain": "notifications.example.com",
        "status": "approved",
        "status_label": "Approved",
        "can_send": true,
        "dkim_status": "valid",
        "cname_status": "valid",
        "created_at": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2024-01-15T11:05:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Delete a Sending Domain

<Warning>
  Deleting a domain removes all associated DNS verification. You won't be able to send emails from this domain until it's re-added and verified.
</Warning>

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Domains** → **Sending**
2. Find the domain and click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm deletion

### Via API

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DNS records not detected">
    - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though most complete within minutes
    - Verify records are added to the correct domain/subdomain
    - Check for typos in record values
    - Ensure you're using the correct record type (TXT vs CNAME)
    - Try using a DNS lookup tool like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/) to verify your records
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DKIM verification failing">
    - Ensure the entire DKIM value is copied (it's a long string)
    - Check that the hostname uses the correct selector (e.g., `scph0722._domainkey`, not just `_domainkey`)
    - Some DNS providers require you to remove quotes from the value
    - Verify the record type is TXT, not CNAME
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CNAME verification failing">
    - Ensure the CNAME record points to `sparkpostmail.com`
    - The CNAME should be set on your root domain
    - Some DNS providers don't allow CNAME on root domains - contact support for alternatives
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Domain stuck in pending status">
    - New domains undergo automatic approval review
    - Domains less than 30 days old may require manual review
    - Contact support if your domain remains pending for more than 24 hours
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot send from verified domain">
    - Check that domain status is `approved`, not just verified
    - Verify your API key has permission to send emails
    - Ensure you're using the exact domain that was verified
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Use subdomains for different email types** - Isolate marketing, transactional, and support emails
2. **Start with DMARC `p=none`** - Monitor authentication results before enforcing
3. **Set up a tracking domain** - Branded links improve click-through rates and trust
4. **Monitor your reputation** - Check deliverability metrics regularly
5. **Keep DNS records updated** - If you change email providers, update your SPF record
