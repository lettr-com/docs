# Tracking Domains

A tracking domain is a custom subdomain used for click tracking links and open tracking pixels in your emails. Instead of using Lettr's default tracking URLs, you can configure your own branded domain like `links.yourcompany.com`. Setting up a tracking domain improves recipient trust, maintains brand consistency, and can help with deliverability since links point to your own domain rather than a third-party service.

## Why Use Custom Tracking Domains?

By default, tracking links in your emails use Lettr's domain:

```
https://track.lettr.dev/c/abc123
```

With a custom tracking domain, links use your brand:

```
https://links.yourcompany.com/c/abc123
```

### Benefits

- **Brand Consistency** - Links show your domain, reinforcing brand recognition
- **Improved Trust** - Recipients are more likely to click familiar links
- **Better Deliverability** - Some spam filters favor custom tracking domains
- **Professional Appearance** - Emails look more polished and legitimate

## Default vs Custom Tracking

| Feature | Default | Custom |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Click links | `track.lettr.dev/c/...` | `links.example.com/c/...` |
| Open pixels | `track.lettr.dev/o/...` | `links.example.com/o/...` |
| SSL | Automatic | Automatic |
| Setup | None required | DNS configuration |

## Adding a Tracking Domain

### Via Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Tracking Domains">
    Go to **Domains** → **Tracking** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Domain">
    Click **Add Domain** and enter your tracking subdomain (e.g., `links.example.com`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add DNS Records">
    Add the provided DNS records to your domain. You'll need:
    - A CNAME record pointing to Lettr's tracking server
    - TXT records for SSL certificate validation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Domain">
    Click **Verify** to check DNS configuration and provision your SSL certificate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via API

Create a tracking domain:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/tracking \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain": "links.example.com"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "domain": "links.example.com",
    "status": "pending_ssl",
    "cname_status": "unverified",
    "ssl_status": "pending",
    "ssl_txt_name": "_acme-challenge.links.example.com",
    "ssl_txt_value": "abc123xyz...",
    "ownership_txt_name": "_cf-custom-hostname.links.example.com",
    "ownership_txt_value": "def456...",
    "cname_target": "proxy.lettr-tracking.io",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## DNS Configuration

After adding your tracking domain, configure these DNS records:

### CNAME Record

Points your subdomain to Lettr's tracking servers:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | CNAME |
| Name | `links` (your chosen subdomain) |
| Value | `proxy.lettr-tracking.io` |

### SSL Validation TXT Record

Required for automatic SSL certificate provisioning:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | TXT |
| Name | `_acme-challenge.links` |
| Value | (provided by Lettr) |

### Ownership TXT Record

Verifies domain ownership:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | TXT |
| Name | `_cf-custom-hostname.links` |
| Value | (provided by Lettr) |

<Note>
  The exact TXT record values are unique to your domain and will be provided when you add your tracking domain. Copy them exactly as shown.
</Note>

## Choosing a Subdomain

Common choices for tracking subdomains:

| Subdomain | Full Domain |
|-----------|-------------|
| `links` | `links.example.com` |
| `track` | `track.example.com` |
| `click` | `click.example.com` |
| `go` | `go.example.com` |
| `e` | `e.example.com` |

<Tip>
  Keep the subdomain short and generic. Avoid words like "tracking" or "analytics" that might trigger spam filters.
</Tip>

## SSL Certificates

Lettr automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates for your tracking domain. This ensures all tracking links use HTTPS.

### Certificate Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `active` | SSL certificate provisioned and active |
| `pending` | Certificate being provisioned |
| `pending_validation` | Waiting for TXT record validation |
| `initializing` | Initial setup in progress |

SSL provisioning typically completes within a few minutes after DNS verification.

## Verifying Your Tracking Domain

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Domains** → **Tracking**
2. Find your domain and click **Verify**
3. Wait for both CNAME and SSL verification to complete

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/tracking/links.example.com/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "domain": "links.example.com",
    "status": "active",
    "cname_status": "valid",
    "cname_verified": true,
    "ssl_status": "active",
    "ssl_verified": true
  }
}
```

## Tracking Domain Status

| Status | Description | CNAME | SSL |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----|
| `active` | Fully verified and operational | Valid | Active |
| `pending_cname` | Waiting for CNAME verification | Pending | Active |
| `pending_ssl` | Waiting for SSL certificate | Valid | Pending |

## Linking to a Sending Domain

Associate your tracking domain with a sending domain so all emails from that domain use your custom tracking links:

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Domains** → **Sending**
2. Select your sending domain
3. Choose your tracking domain from the dropdown

### Via API

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tracking_domain": "links.example.com"
  }'
```

## Using Custom Tracking

Once configured, all tracking automatically uses your custom domain. No code changes needed.

### Click Tracking

When you enable click tracking, links in your email:

**Original link in your email:**
```html
<a href="https://example.com/offer">View Offer</a>
```

**Link in delivered email (with tracking):**
```html
<a href="https://links.example.com/c/abc123">View Offer</a>
```

When clicked, the recipient is redirected to `https://example.com/offer` and the click is recorded.

### Open Tracking

When you enable open tracking, a tracking pixel is added:

```html
<img src="https://links.example.com/o/xyz789" width="1" height="1" />
```

## Enabling Tracking in Emails

Enable tracking when sending emails:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.lettr.com/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "hello@example.com",
    "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
    "subject": "Check out our new features",
    "html": "<p>Click <a href=\"https://example.com/features\">here</a> to learn more.</p>",
    "options": {
      "click_tracking": true,
      "open_tracking": true
    }
  }'
```

## Check Tracking Domain Status

### Via API

```bash
curl https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/tracking/links.example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "domain": "links.example.com",
    "status": "active",
    "cname_status": "valid",
    "ssl_status": "active",
    "ssl_txt_name": "_acme-challenge.links.example.com",
    "ssl_txt_value": "abc123xyz...",
    "ownership_txt_name": "_cf-custom-hostname.links.example.com",
    "ownership_txt_value": "def456...",
    "cname_target": "proxy.lettr-tracking.io",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## List All Tracking Domains

```bash
curl https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/tracking \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "domains": [
      {
        "domain": "links.example.com",
        "status": "active",
        "cname_status": "valid",
        "ssl_status": "active"
      },
      {
        "domain": "track.othersite.com",
        "status": "pending_ssl",
        "cname_status": "valid",
        "ssl_status": "pending"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Delete a Tracking Domain

<Warning>
  Deleting a tracking domain will cause tracking links in previously sent emails to stop working. Recipients clicking those links will see an error.
</Warning>

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Domains** → **Tracking**
2. Find the domain and click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

### Via API

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.lettr.com/api/domains/tracking/links.example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CNAME not verified">
    - Verify the CNAME record is pointing to `proxy.lettr-tracking.io`
    - Check that you added the record to the correct subdomain
    - DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, though usually completes in minutes
    - Some DNS providers require the full domain in the name field (e.g., `links.example.com` instead of `links`)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSL certificate pending">
    - Ensure both TXT records are added correctly
    - TXT record values must match exactly (including any trailing characters)
    - Certificate provisioning can take up to 24 hours in rare cases
    - If stuck, try removing and re-adding the tracking domain
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tracking links not using custom domain">
    - Verify the tracking domain is linked to your sending domain
    - Check that tracking domain status is `active`
    - Only emails sent after configuration will use the custom domain
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Certificate renewal issues">
    - SSL certificates auto-renew before expiration
    - If renewal fails, check that TXT records are still in place
    - Contact support if certificates expire unexpectedly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Changing your tracking domain won't affect previously sent emails. Only new emails will use the updated tracking domain.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Use a dedicated subdomain** - Don't use your root domain for tracking
2. **Keep subdomains short** - Shorter URLs look cleaner in emails
3. **Avoid suspicious words** - Skip words like "tracking" or "click" in the subdomain
4. **Set up before sending** - Configure tracking domains before email campaigns
5. **Monitor SSL status** - Ensure certificates stay active
