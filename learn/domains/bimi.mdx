# BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)

BIMI allows your brand logo to appear next to your emails in supported email clients, increasing brand recognition and trust with recipients.

## What is BIMI?

When BIMI is configured, email clients display your verified logo in the sender avatar area instead of a generic icon or initials. This provides visual brand verification that helps recipients identify legitimate emails from your organization.

## Prerequisites

BIMI requires strong email authentication. Before setting up BIMI, you must have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="SPF Configured">
    SPF record must be present and passing. See [SPF guide](/learn/domains/spf).
  </Step>
  <Step title="DKIM Configured">
    DKIM signing must be active and passing. See [DKIM guide](/learn/domains/dkim).
  </Step>
  <Step title="DMARC Enforced">
    DMARC policy must be set to `quarantine` or `reject` with `pct=100`.

    ```
    v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com
    ```

    See [DMARC guide](/learn/domains/dmarc) for setup instructions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  BIMI will not work with `p=none`. You must enforce DMARC at `quarantine` or `reject` level. Use [DMARCeye.com](https://dmarceye.com) to safely transition to DMARC enforcement.
</Warning>

## How BIMI Works

```

1. Email is received and passes DMARC authentication
2. Receiving server looks up your BIMI record in DNS
3. Server fetches your logo (and verifies VMC if required)
4. Logo is displayed next to your email in the recipient's inbox

## Logo Requirements

Your logo must meet specific technical requirements:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Format** | SVG Tiny 1.2 Portable/Secure (SVG Tiny PS) |
| **Shape** | Square (centered logo on solid background) |
| **Background** | Solid color (no transparency) |
| **Minimum Size** | Renders clearly at 32x32 pixels |
| **Maximum File Size** | Under 32 KB |
| **Content** | No animation, no external references |

### SVG Tiny PS Requirements

Standard SVG files won't work. Your logo must be in SVG Tiny PS format:

```xml
<svg version="1.2" baseProfile="tiny-ps"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <!-- Logo content -->
</svg>
```

<Tip>
  Use a BIMI logo generator tool to convert your standard logo to the required SVG Tiny PS format.
</Tip>

## Verified Mark Certificate (VMC)

Some email clients require a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) to display your logo:

| Email Client | VMC Required |
|--------------|--------------|
| Gmail | Yes |
| Yahoo Mail | Yes |
| Apple Mail | No (basic BIMI support) |
| Fastmail | No |
| AOL | Yes |

### Getting a VMC

VMC certificates are issued by authorized Certificate Authorities:

- **DigiCert** - [digicert.com/tls-ssl/verified-mark-certificates](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/verified-mark-certificates)
- **Entrust** - [entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-certificates/verified-mark-certificates](https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-certificates/verified-mark-certificates)

### VMC Requirements

To obtain a VMC, you need:

1. **Registered Trademark** - Your logo must be a registered trademark
2. **Trademark Verification** - The CA verifies your trademark registration
3. **Organization Validation** - Extended validation of your organization
4. **Logo Verification** - Confirmation that the logo matches your trademark

<Note>
  VMC certificates cost several thousand dollars annually and require trademark registration. Consider this investment for high-volume senders where brand recognition is critical.
</Note>

## BIMI DNS Record

Add a TXT record to your domain:

```
Type:  TXT
Host:  default._bimi
Value: v=BIMI1; l=https://example.com/bimi/logo.svg; a=https://example.com/bimi/vmc.pem
```

### Record Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `v=BIMI1` | BIMI version | Yes |
| `l=` | HTTPS URL to your SVG logo | Yes |
| `a=` | HTTPS URL to your VMC certificate | For Gmail, Yahoo, AOL |

### Without VMC (Basic BIMI)

If you don't have a VMC, omit the `a=` parameter:

```
v=BIMI1; l=https://example.com/bimi/logo.svg
```

This will work for email clients that support basic BIMI (Apple Mail, Fastmail).

## Setup BIMI in Lettr

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Domains** and select your sending domain
2. Navigate to the **BIMI** section
3. Enter your logo URL and optional VMC URL
4. Save and verify the configuration

### Via API

```javascript
await lettr.domains.update('dom_123', {
  bimi: {
    logoUrl: 'https://example.com/bimi/logo.svg',
    vmcUrl: 'https://example.com/bimi/vmc.pem'  // Optional
  }
});
```

## Verify BIMI Setup

```javascript
const domain = await lettr.domains.get('dom_123');

console.log({
  bimiStatus: domain.bimiStatus,     // 'active', 'pending', 'invalid'
  bimiLogoUrl: domain.bimiLogoUrl,
  bimiVmcUrl: domain.bimiVmcUrl,
  bimiRecord: domain.bimiRecord
});
```

## Hosting Your Logo

Your logo must be hosted on a publicly accessible HTTPS URL:

```
https://example.com/bimi/logo.svg
```

Requirements for hosting:

- **HTTPS only** - HTTP URLs won't work
- **No authentication** - Logo must be publicly accessible
- **Reliable hosting** - Logo must always be available
- **Correct Content-Type** - Server must return `image/svg+xml`

### Using Lettr Storage

You can host your BIMI logo on your [storage domain](/learn/domains/storage-domains):

```javascript
const logo = await lettr.storage.upload({
  file: fs.readFileSync('./bimi-logo.svg'),
  filename: 'bimi-logo.svg',
  contentType: 'image/svg+xml',
  path: 'bimi/'
});

console.log(logo.url);
// https://images.example.com/bimi/bimi-logo.svg
```

## Testing BIMI

1. **Validate DNS Record** - Use a BIMI lookup tool to verify your TXT record
2. **Validate Logo** - Ensure your SVG meets all format requirements
3. **Send Test Emails** - Send to Gmail, Yahoo, and other supporting clients
4. **Check Display** - Verify logo appears in the recipient's inbox

### BIMI Inspector Tools

- **BIMI Group Inspector** - [bimigroup.org/bimi-generator](https://bimigroup.org/bimi-generator/)
- **MXToolbox BIMI Lookup** - [mxtoolbox.com/bimi.aspx](https://mxtoolbox.com/bimi.aspx)

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Logo not displaying | DMARC not enforced | Set DMARC to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` |
| Gmail not showing logo | No VMC | Obtain a VMC from DigiCert or Entrust |
| Invalid logo error | Wrong SVG format | Convert to SVG Tiny PS format |
| DNS lookup fails | Wrong record location | Ensure record is at `default._bimi` |
| VMC validation fails | Certificate expired | Renew your VMC certificate |

## BIMI Without VMC Strategy

If you can't obtain a VMC, you can still benefit from basic BIMI:

1. Set up BIMI with just the logo URL
2. Your logo will display in Apple Mail, Fastmail, and other basic BIMI clients
3. For Gmail and Yahoo, continue building trust through consistent, authenticated sending
4. Consider obtaining a VMC in the future as your email program grows
