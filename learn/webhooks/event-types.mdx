---

This page provides a complete reference of all 21 webhook event types that Lettr can send, organized into five categories.

## Message Events

These events track the delivery lifecycle of emails you send through Lettr.

### message.injection

Triggered when an email is accepted by Lettr and queued for delivery. This is the first event in any email's lifecycle.

### message.delivery

Triggered when an email is successfully delivered to the recipient's mail server. This is the most reliable indicator that the email reached its destination.

<Note>
  A delivery event means the recipient's mail server accepted the email. It does not guarantee the email reached the inbox — it could be filtered to spam or quarantined by the recipient's email provider.
</Note>

### message.bounce

Triggered when an email cannot be delivered. Bounces can be hard (permanent failure, such as a non-existent address) or soft (temporary issue, such as a full mailbox).

<Warning>
  Always handle hard bounces by removing the address from your mailing list. Continuing to send to hard-bounced addresses damages your sender reputation.
</Warning>

### message.delay

Triggered when email delivery is temporarily delayed. Lettr will continue retrying delivery automatically. Delays are common with large mail providers that throttle incoming connections.

### message.out_of_band

Triggered when an out-of-band bounce occurs. These arrive after the initial delivery appeared successful — the receiving server accepted the message initially, then later determined it could not be delivered and sent a separate bounce notification.

### message.spam_complaint

Triggered when a recipient marks an email as spam. This is a serious signal that should trigger immediate suppression.

<Warning>
  Spam complaints severely impact your sender reputation. Always immediately suppress addresses that generate complaints and never send to them again. High complaint rates can result in your sending being suspended.
</Warning>

### message.policy_rejection

Triggered when an email is rejected due to a policy rule before delivery was attempted. This could be due to content filtering, rate limits, or a configuration issue.

## Engagement Events

These events indicate that the recipient interacted with your email. Engagement events require open and/or click tracking to be enabled.

<Note>
  The engagement event category contains a known typo in the event names: `engagament` (missing an 'e'). This is intentional for backward compatibility and must be used exactly as shown.
</Note>

### engagament.open

Triggered when a recipient opens an email. Open tracking works by embedding a small invisible image in the email. Some email clients block images by default or prefetch them automatically, so open rates are an approximation rather than an exact count.

### engagament.initial_open

Triggered on the first open of an email by a recipient. Subsequent opens of the same email generate `engagament.open` events instead.

### engagament.click

Triggered when a recipient clicks a link in an email. Requires click tracking to be enabled. Click data is generally more reliable than open data because it requires deliberate user action.

### engagament.amp_open

Triggered when a recipient opens an email delivered in AMP format.

### engagament.amp_initial_open

Triggered on the first open of an AMP email by a recipient.

### engagament.amp_click

Triggered when a recipient clicks a link within an AMP email.

---

## Generation Events

These events occur when there is a problem generating (assembling and preparing) a message for delivery.

### generation.generation_failure

Triggered when something goes wrong while preparing the message for delivery. This is typically an infrastructure-level issue rather than something caused by your email content.

### generation.generation_rejection

Triggered when a message is blocked during the generation phase — the point where the email is assembled and prepared for sending.

---

## Unsubscribe Events

These events track when recipients opt out of receiving your emails.

### unsubscribe.list_unsubscribe

Triggered when a recipient unsubscribes via the List-Unsubscribe header, a one-click unsubscribe mechanism built into email standards.

### unsubscribe.link_unsubscribe

Triggered when a recipient unsubscribes by clicking an unsubscribe link in the email body.

---

## Relay Events

These events are triggered by inbound email processing on your configured inbound domains.

### relay.relay_injection

Triggered when an inbound email is received and queued for processing.

### relay.relay_delivery

Triggered when an inbound email is successfully delivered to your configured endpoint.

### relay.relay_rejection

Triggered when an inbound email is rejected.

### relay.relay_tempfail

Triggered when delivery of an inbound email to your endpoint temporarily fails. Lettr will retry automatically.

### relay.relay_permfail

Triggered when delivery of an inbound email to your endpoint permanently fails after all retry attempts are exhausted.
