# Premade Templates

Premade templates are professionally designed email templates that you can use as starting points for your own designs. Instead of building templates from scratch, browse the template library, pick a design that fits your needs, and customize it with your own content and branding.

## Browsing Templates

To access premade templates:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Template Library">
    Navigate to **Templates** in the sidebar and click **New Template**. Select **Start from a Premade Template** to open the template library.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse by Category">
    Templates are organized into categories to help you find the right design. Browse through the available options or use the folder navigation to narrow your search.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview a Template">
    Click on any template to see a full preview of its design, including how it looks on desktop and mobile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using a Premade Template

When you select a premade template, Lettr creates a new template in your project based on that design. The new template is an independent copy — changes you make won't affect the original premade template, and updates to the library won't change your copy.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Template">
    Click on the premade template you want to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize">
    The template opens in the visual editor where you can modify the content, colors, images, and layout to match your brand.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save your customized template. It now appears in your project like any other template, with full version history and editing capabilities.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Can Customize

Once you create a template from a premade design, you have full control over every aspect:

- **Text content** — Replace placeholder text with your own copy
- **Images** — Swap out stock images for your brand assets
- **Colors** — Update colors to match your brand palette
- **Layout** — Add, remove, or rearrange structures and content blocks
- **Merge tags** — Insert dynamic variables for personalization
- **Links** — Update all URLs to point to your destinations

## Premade Templates vs Starting from Scratch

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Premade template** | Getting started quickly, following proven email design patterns, teams without dedicated email designers |
| **Start from scratch** | Highly custom designs, unique layouts, teams with specific brand guidelines that don't match any premade option |

<Tip>
  Even if you plan to heavily customize, starting from a premade template can save time by providing a solid responsive foundation that you can modify.
