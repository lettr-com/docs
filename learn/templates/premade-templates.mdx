Premade templates are professionally designed email templates that you can use as starting points for your own designs. Instead of building templates from scratch, browse the template gallery, pick a design that fits your needs, and customize it with your own content and branding.

## Browsing Templates

To access premade templates:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Template Gallery">
    Navigate to **Emails** in the sidebar and click **New Template**. The template gallery opens, showing all available premade templates alongside a **Create from scratch** option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by Style or Category">
    Use the **style** and **category** dropdown filters to narrow your search and find the right design.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview a Template">
    Click on any template to see a full preview of its design.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using a Premade Template

When you create a template from a premade design, Lettr creates a new template in your account based on that design. The new template is an independent copy — changes you make won't affect the original premade template, and updates to the library won't change your copy.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preview">
    Click on a premade template to see a preview of the design.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create Template**. Lettr creates a new template in your account with the premade design and opens it in the visual editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize">
    Modify the content, colors, images, and layout to match your brand, then save your changes. The template appears in your templates like any other, with full editing and versioning capabilities.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  During onboarding, Lettr automatically populates your folders with premade templates that match your business type. These templates are ready to customize and send right away.
</Note>

## What You Can Customize

Once you create a template from a premade design, you have full control over every aspect:

- **Text content** — Replace placeholder text with your own copy
- **Images** — Swap out stock images for your brand assets
- **Colors** — Update colors to match your brand palette
- **Layout** — Add, remove, or rearrange structures and content blocks
- **Merge tags** — Insert dynamic variables for personalization
- **Links** — Update all URLs to point to your destinations

## Premade Templates vs Starting from Scratch

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Premade template** | Getting started quickly, following proven email design patterns, teams without dedicated email designers |
| **Start from scratch** | Highly custom designs, unique layouts, teams with specific brand guidelines that don't match any premade option |

<Tip>
  Even if you plan to heavily customize, starting from a premade template can save time by providing a solid responsive foundation that you can modify.
