Projects and folders help you organize your email templates. Use projects to separate templates by brand, product, or team, and use folders within projects to group related templates together.

## Overview

The template hierarchy in Lettr works as follows:

```
Team
└── Project (e.g., "Marketing Site")
    ├── Folder (e.g., "Transactional")
    │   ├── Template: welcome-email
    │   ├── Template: password-reset
    │   └── Template: order-confirmation
    └── Folder (e.g., "Newsletters")
        ├── Template: weekly-digest
        └── Template: product-updates
```

Every team has a default project created automatically. You can create additional projects as needed.

## Projects

### Creating a Project

Create projects in the dashboard to separate templates by purpose:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Projects">
    Click your project name in the sidebar, then click **New Project**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Project">
    Enter a project name and optionally select an emoji for visual identification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Storage">
    Optionally select a storage domain for templates in this project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Project Settings

Each project has the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Name | Display name for the project |
| Emoji | Visual identifier (optional) |
| Storage Domain | Default storage domain for template images |
| Default | Whether this is the default project for new templates |

### Storage Domain per Project

Associate a storage domain with a project to have all template images served from that domain:

```
Project: "Brand A"
Storage Domain: assets.brand-a.com

Project: "Brand B"
Storage Domain: cdn.brand-b.com
```

This ensures each brand's emails use their own branded image URLs.

## Folders

Folders help organize templates within a project.

### Creating a Folder

1. Open a project in the Templates view
2. Click **New Folder**
3. Enter a folder name
4. Click **Create**

### Folder Structure

Folders are single-level within a project—you cannot nest folders within folders. This keeps the structure simple and navigable:

```
Project: "E-commerce"
├── Folder: "Order Lifecycle"
│   ├── order-confirmation
│   ├── shipping-notification
│   └── delivery-confirmation
├── Folder: "Account"
│   ├── welcome
│   ├── password-reset
│   └── email-verification
└── Folder: "Marketing"
    ├── promotional
    └── newsletter
```

## Using Projects in API Calls

When sending emails with templates, you can specify which project to use:

```javascript
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Welcome',
  template_slug: 'welcome-email',
  project_id: 123
});
```

<Note>
  If you don't specify a `project_id`, Lettr uses the default project for your team.
</Note>

### Listing Templates by Project

When retrieving templates via API, templates are returned with their project context:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.lettr.com/api/templates" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lttr_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Response includes project information:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Welcome Email",
      "slug": "welcome-email",
      "project_id": 123,
      "folder_id": 3,
      "created_at": "2026-01-10T09:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-01-15T14:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Order Confirmation",
      "slug": "order-confirmation",
      "project_id": 123,
      "folder_id": 5,
      "created_at": "2026-01-12T11:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-01-20T08:15:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Moving Templates

### Move to Another Folder

Move a template to a different folder within the same project:

1. Open the template
2. Click the **More** menu (three dots)
3. Select **Move to Folder**
4. Choose the destination folder

### Move to Another Project

Move a template to a different project:

1. Open the template
2. Click the **More** menu
3. Select **Move to Project**
4. Choose the destination project and folder

<Warning>
  Moving a template to a different project may affect API calls that reference the template by `project_id`. Update your integration to use the new project ID after moving.
</Warning>

### Copy to Another Project or Team

Duplicate a template while keeping the original:

1. Open the template
2. Click the **More** menu
3. Select **Duplicate to Project** or **Duplicate to Team**
4. Choose the destination project, folder, or team

This creates an independent copy that can be modified without affecting the original.

#### Cross-Team Duplication

If you belong to multiple teams, you can duplicate templates across teams. This is useful for:

- **Sharing designs between teams** — Copy a polished template from one team to another without recreating it
- **Agency workflows** — Duplicate a base template to multiple client teams
- **Environment promotion** — Copy templates from a staging team to production

When duplicating to another team, the template is copied with its content but is otherwise independent — it gets its own version history, and changes in one team don't affect the other.

<Note>
  You must be a member of the destination team to duplicate templates to it.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Project Organization

- **By Brand**: Create separate projects for each brand if you send emails from multiple brands
- **By Product**: Separate projects for different products or services
- **By Environment**: Consider separate projects for production vs. staging if testing extensively

### Folder Organization

- **By Email Type**: Group transactional, marketing, and notification emails
- **By Customer Journey**: Organize by lifecycle stage (onboarding, engagement, retention)
- **By Frequency**: Separate one-time emails from recurring ones

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming patterns:

```
Projects:
- "Acme SaaS"
- "Acme Enterprise"
- "Internal Communications"

Folders:
- "Transactional"
- "Onboarding Sequence"
- "Product Updates"

Templates (slugs):
- welcome-email
- password-reset
- weekly-digest-v2
```

## Default Project

Every team has a default project. This project:

- Cannot be deleted
- Receives templates when no project is specified
- Is used when API calls don't include a `project_id`

To change the default project:

1. Go to project settings
2. Click **Set as Default**

<Note>
  You cannot delete the default project. If you want to delete a project, first set a different project as the default.
</Note>

## Deleting Projects and Folders

### Deleting a Folder

When you delete a folder:

- All templates in the folder are permanently deleted
- This action cannot be undone

<Warning>
  Deleting a folder permanently removes all templates inside it. Move important templates to another folder before deleting.
</Warning>

### Deleting a Project

When you delete a project:

- All templates and folders in the project are permanently deleted
- This action cannot be undone

<Warning>
  Deleting a project permanently removes all its templates. Export or move important templates before deleting.
</Warning>
