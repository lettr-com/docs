Saved blocks let you create reusable email sections that can be used across multiple templates. Save common components once—like headers, footers, or promotional sections—and reuse them throughout your templates.

## What Are Saved Blocks?

When designing email templates, you'll often create sections that you want to reuse—a branded header, a footer with social links, or a promotional banner. Instead of recreating these sections for each template, you can save them as **saved blocks** and insert them into any template with a single click.

Saved blocks are stored in your team's block library and are accessible to all team members through the **Saved Blocks** panel in the email editor.

## Saved Sections vs Synced Sections

Lettr offers two types of reusable sections, each with different behavior:

| Aspect | Saved Section | Synced Section |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **After insertion** | Creates an independent copy | Maintains a live link to the original |
| **When you edit it** | Changes only affect that template | Changes update ALL templates using it |
| **Best for** | Content that varies per template | Content that must stay consistent everywhere |
| **Risk level** | Low (isolated changes) | Higher (global impact) |

### How to Choose

**Use a Saved Section when:**
- You need a starting point but will customize it for each template
- The content varies between emails (e.g., different promotional messages)
- You want flexibility without affecting other templates

**Use a Synced Section when:**
- The content must be identical across all templates (e.g., legal disclaimers)
- You need to update many templates at once (e.g., changing your company address)
- Consistency is more important than flexibility

## Types of Blocks

Lettr supports three types of saved content:

| Type | Description | Updates |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Saved Section** | A copy of a section that can be reused | Independent after insertion |
| **Synced Section** | A linked section that stays synchronized | Updates all templates using it |
| **Folder** | Organizes blocks into groups | N/A |

## Saved Sections

A saved section is a reusable copy of an email section. When you insert a saved section into a template, it creates an independent copy that can be customized.

### Creating a Saved Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design the Section">
    In the email editor, create the section you want to save.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Section">
    Select the section and use the save option in the editor toolbar or context menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and Organize">
    Give the block a name and optionally select a folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Saved Sections

1. Open the **Saved Blocks** panel in the editor
2. Drag a saved section into your template
3. The section is inserted as an independent copy
4. Customize as needed—changes don't affect the original

<Note>
  Saved sections are copies. After inserting, the block in your template is independent from the original saved block.
</Note>

## Synced Sections

Synced sections maintain a live connection to the original block. When you update a synced section, all templates using it are automatically updated.

### Use Cases for Synced Sections

- **Company footer**: Update contact info or social links in one place
- **Legal disclaimers**: Maintain consistent compliance text
- **Brand header**: Keep your header consistent across all emails
- **Promotional banners**: Update a sale banner across all templates instantly

### Creating a Synced Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design the Section">
    Create the section in the email editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save as Synced">
    Select the section and choose the synced section option when saving. This links the block across all templates that use it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Section">
    Give it a descriptive name like "Company Footer" or "Legal Disclaimer".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Synced Sections

1. Open the **Saved Blocks** panel
2. Drag a synced section (marked with a sync icon) into your template
3. The section appears in your template with a link indicator
4. Any updates to the synced section will propagate to this template

### Editing Synced Sections

To update a synced section:

1. Open any template containing the synced section
2. Select the synced section in the editor
3. Use the edit option to modify the source block
4. Save your changes—they automatically update all templates using this section

<Warning>
  Changes to synced sections affect all templates that use them. Preview affected templates before saving major changes.
</Warning>

### Converting Between Types

You can convert between saved and synced sections:

- **Synced to Saved**: Select a synced section in your template and unlink it. This converts it to an independent copy that won't be affected by future updates to the original.
- **Saved to Synced**: Create a new synced section from any section in the editor.

## Organizing with Folders

Folders help organize your saved blocks library.

### Creating Folders

1. Open the **Saved Blocks** panel
2. Click **New Folder**
3. Enter a folder name

### Managing Folders

- Move blocks into folders to organize them
- Rename or delete folders as needed
- Folders can be nested within other folders for deeper organization

### Folder Structure Example

```
Saved Blocks
├── Headers
│   ├── Primary Header (synced)
│   └── Minimal Header (saved)
├── Footers
│   ├── Full Footer with Social (synced)
│   └── Simple Footer (synced)
├── Promotional
│   ├── Sale Banner (saved)
│   └── Feature Highlight (saved)
└── Legal
    └── Unsubscribe Block (synced)
```

## Block Properties

Each saved block includes the following properties in API responses:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier for the block |
| `name` | Display name for the block |
| `type` | `saved_section`, `synced_section`, or `folder` |
| `definition` | The block's design and content (JSON object) |
| `image` | Preview thumbnail URL (optional) |
| `folder_id` | Parent folder ID, if organized in a folder (optional) |
| `created_at` | Timestamp when the block was created |

## Team-Wide Blocks

Saved blocks are shared across your entire team. This means:

- All team members can use and manage saved blocks
- Synced sections update for all team members simultaneously
- Consistent branding across all team members' work

### Real-Time Updates

When a team member updates a synced section, the changes are broadcast in real-time. If another team member has a template open that uses that synced section, they'll see the updated content automatically without needing to refresh.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Saved Sections

- **Variable content**: Sections that need customization per template
- **Starting points**: Base designs to modify for specific needs
- **Template-specific content**: Sections that differ between templates

### When to Use Synced Sections

- **Brand elements**: Headers, footers, logos
- **Legal content**: Disclaimers, unsubscribe blocks, privacy notices
- **Contact information**: Address, phone, social links
- **Time-sensitive content**: Promotional banners, announcements

### Organization Tips

1. **Use descriptive names**: "Primary Header with Logo" instead of "Header 1"
2. **Create logical folders**: Group by purpose (Headers, Footers, CTAs) or by brand
3. **Mark synced sections clearly**: Include "(Synced)" in names if helpful
4. **Review regularly**: Delete unused blocks to keep the library clean
5. **Document changes**: When updating synced sections, communicate with your team

## Working with Translations

Saved blocks support translations for multi-language email templates. The translation data is stored as a language-keyed object:

```json
{
  "en": {
    "name": "Welcome Header"
  },
  "es": {
    "name": "Encabezado de Bienvenida"
  },
  "de": {
    "name": "Willkommens-Header"
  }
}
```

The translation structure follows the Topol editor's format, where each language code maps to an object containing translatable content. When used in a template with a specific language setting, the block displays the appropriate translated content.

## Limitations

- Blocks are team-scoped (cannot share across teams)
- Synced sections require the block to exist—deleting a synced block breaks templates using it
- Block content is stored as Topol editor JSON format

<Warning>
  Before deleting a synced section, check which templates use it. Deleting breaks the sync and may leave templates incomplete.
</Warning>
