# Saved Blocks

Saved blocks let you create reusable email sections that can be used across multiple templates. Save common components once—like headers, footers, or promotional sections—and reuse them throughout your templates.

## Types of Blocks

Lettr supports three types of saved content:

| Type | Description | Updates |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Saved Section** | A copy of a section that can be reused | Independent after insertion |
| **Synced Section** | A linked section that stays synchronized | Updates all templates using it |
| **Folder** | Organizes blocks into groups | N/A |

## Saved Sections

A saved section is a reusable copy of an email section. When you insert a saved section into a template, it creates an independent copy that can be customized.

### Creating a Saved Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design the Section">
    In the email editor, create the section you want to save.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Section">
    Hover over the section and click the **Save** icon, or right-click and select **Save as Block**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and Organize">
    Give the block a name and optionally select a folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Saved Sections

1. Open the **Saved Blocks** panel in the editor
2. Drag a saved section into your template
3. The section is inserted as an independent copy
4. Customize as needed—changes don't affect the original

<Note>
  Saved sections are copies. After inserting, the block in your template is independent from the original saved block.
</Note>

## Synced Sections

Synced sections maintain a live connection to the original block. When you update a synced section, all templates using it are automatically updated.

### Use Cases for Synced Sections

- **Company footer**: Update contact info or social links in one place
- **Legal disclaimers**: Maintain consistent compliance text
- **Brand header**: Keep your header consistent across all emails
- **Promotional banners**: Update a sale banner across all templates instantly

### Creating a Synced Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design the Section">
    Create the section in the email editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save as Synced">
    Right-click the section and select **Save as Synced Section**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Section">
    Give it a descriptive name like "Company Footer" or "Legal Disclaimer".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Synced Sections

1. Open the **Saved Blocks** panel
2. Drag a synced section (marked with a sync icon) into your template
3. The section appears in your template with a link indicator
4. Any updates to the synced section will propagate to this template

### Editing Synced Sections

To update a synced section:

1. Open any template containing the synced section
2. Click on the synced section
3. Click **Edit Original** to modify the source block
4. Changes automatically update all templates using this section

<Warning>
  Changes to synced sections affect all templates that use them. Preview affected templates before saving major changes.
</Warning>

### Converting Between Types

You can convert between saved and synced sections:

- **Synced to Saved**: Click a synced section and select **Unlink**. This creates an independent copy in that template.
- **Saved to Synced**: Save a section as a new synced section from the editor.

## Organizing with Folders

Folders help organize your saved blocks library.

### Creating Folders

1. Open the **Saved Blocks** panel
2. Click **New Folder**
3. Enter a folder name

### Managing Folders

- Drag blocks into folders to organize them
- Rename folders by right-clicking
- Delete empty folders (blocks must be moved or deleted first)

### Folder Structure Example

```
Saved Blocks
├── Headers
│   ├── Primary Header (synced)
│   └── Minimal Header (saved)
├── Footers
│   ├── Full Footer with Social (synced)
│   └── Simple Footer (synced)
├── Promotional
│   ├── Sale Banner (saved)
│   └── Feature Highlight (saved)
└── Legal
    └── Unsubscribe Block (synced)
```

## Block Properties

Each saved block has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Display name for the block |
| `type` | `saved_section`, `synced_section`, or `folder` |
| `definition` | The block's design and content (JSON) |
| `image` | Preview thumbnail of the block |
| `folder_id` | Parent folder (if organized in a folder) |

## Team-Wide Blocks

Saved blocks are shared across your entire team. This means:

- All team members can use and manage saved blocks
- Synced sections update for all team members simultaneously
- Consistent branding across all team members' work

## Best Practices

### When to Use Saved Sections

- **Variable content**: Sections that need customization per template
- **Starting points**: Base designs to modify for specific needs
- **Template-specific content**: Sections that differ between templates

### When to Use Synced Sections

- **Brand elements**: Headers, footers, logos
- **Legal content**: Disclaimers, unsubscribe blocks, privacy notices
- **Contact information**: Address, phone, social links
- **Time-sensitive content**: Promotional banners, announcements

### Organization Tips

1. **Use descriptive names**: "Primary Header with Logo" instead of "Header 1"
2. **Create logical folders**: Group by purpose (Headers, Footers, CTAs) or by brand
3. **Mark synced sections clearly**: Include "(Synced)" in names if helpful
4. **Review regularly**: Delete unused blocks to keep the library clean
5. **Document changes**: When updating synced sections, communicate with your team

## Working with Translations

Saved blocks support translations for multi-language email templates:

```json
{
  "translation": {
    "en": {
      "heading": "Welcome to our newsletter",
      "cta": "Learn More"
    },
    "es": {
      "heading": "Bienvenido a nuestro boletín",
      "cta": "Más información"
    }
  }
}
```

When used in a template with a specific language, the block displays the appropriate translated content.

## Limitations

- Blocks are team-scoped (cannot share across teams)
- Maximum of one folder level (no nested folders)
- Synced sections require the block to exist—deleting a synced block breaks templates using it
- Block content is stored as Topol editor JSON format

<Warning>
  Before deleting a synced section, check which templates use it. Deleting breaks the sync and may leave templates incomplete.
</Warning>
