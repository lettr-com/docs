# Template Versions

Template versions let you create snapshots of your templates, control which version is active, and schedule version publishing. This enables safe iteration on templates while maintaining a stable production version.

## How Versioning Works

Each template can have multiple versions:

```
Template: "order-confirmation"
├── Version 1 (created Jan 1)
├── Version 2 (created Jan 15)
└── Version 3 (active, created Feb 1)
```

Only one version can be active at a time. When you send emails using this template, the **active version** is used.

## Viewing Versions

In the template editor:

1. Open a template
2. Click the **Versions** tab in the sidebar
3. View all versions with their status and creation dates

Each version shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Version number | Sequential version identifier |
| Status | Active, Inactive, or Scheduled |
| Created | When this version was created |
| Publish date | When the version will become active (if scheduled) |

## Creating a New Version

Create a version to snapshot your current template state:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Template">
    Navigate to the template you want to version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Versions">
    Click the **Versions** tab in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Version">
    Click **Create Version** and configure:
    - **Active**: Whether to immediately activate this version
    - **Publish At**: Optional date to automatically activate
    - **Merge Tags**: Required template variables for this version
  </Step>
</Steps>

When you create a version:

- The current template content (HTML and JSON) is copied to the new version
- The version number auto-increments
- You can optionally activate it immediately or schedule it

## Active vs Inactive Versions

### Active Version

The active version is used when sending emails:

```javascript
// This uses the active version
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Your Order',
  template_slug: 'order-confirmation'
});
```

Only one version per template can be active. When you activate a version, the previously active version becomes inactive.

### Using a Specific Version

Override the active version by specifying a version number:

```javascript
// Use version 2 specifically
await lettr.emails.send({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Your Order',
  template_slug: 'order-confirmation',
  template_version: 2
});
```

<Note>
  When no version is specified, Lettr always uses the active version. Use specific versions for testing or when you need to send an older version.
</Note>

## Scheduled Publishing

Schedule a version to become active at a future date:

1. Create or edit a version
2. Set the **Publish At** date and time
3. The version will automatically activate at that time

Use scheduled publishing to:

- Plan template updates ahead of time
- Coordinate template changes with marketing campaigns
- Deploy changes during low-traffic periods

```
Version 3: Active now
Version 4: Scheduled to publish Jan 15 at 9:00 AM
```

When Version 4's publish time arrives, it automatically becomes active and Version 3 becomes inactive.

## Merge Tags (Template Variables)

Each version can define its required merge tags (template variables):

```json
{
  "merge_tags": [
    { "key": "customer_name", "required": true },
    { "key": "order_id", "required": true },
    { "key": "order_total", "required": false }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `key` | Variable name as used in the template (e.g., `{{customer_name}}`) |
| `required` | Whether this variable must be provided when sending |

<Warning>
  Required merge tags must be included in `substitution_data` when sending. Sending without required variables will result in the variable placeholder appearing in the email.
</Warning>

## Editor Type

Templates can be created with different editor types:

| Editor Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `topol` | Created with the visual drag-and-drop Topol editor |
| `custom_html` | Created with custom HTML code |

The editor type is stored per version, allowing you to switch between visual and code editing across versions.

## Reverting to a Previous Version

To restore an older version:

1. Open the template's **Versions** tab
2. Find the version you want to restore
3. Click **Activate** to make it the active version

This immediately makes the selected version active for all future sends.

<Tip>
  Before making major changes, create a new version. This gives you a snapshot to revert to if needed.
</Tip>

## Deleting Versions

You can delete inactive versions to clean up old iterations:

1. Open the template's **Versions** tab
2. Find the version to delete
3. Click **Delete**

<Warning>
  You cannot delete the active version. To delete it, first activate a different version.
</Warning>

## Version Workflow

A typical versioning workflow:

```
1. Edit template (changes are auto-saved)
2. Test with preview and test emails
3. Create new version when ready to publish
4. Activate the new version (or schedule it)
5. Previous version remains available for rollback
```

### Best Practices

1. **Version before major changes**: Create a version before redesigning a template
2. **Use scheduled publishing**: Schedule major changes for optimal timing
3. **Keep a working version active**: Always have a tested, stable version active
4. **Document changes**: Use version numbers to track what changed between versions
5. **Clean up old versions**: Delete versions you no longer need to keep the list manageable

## Version Comparison

Compare versions by:

1. Opening a version's preview
2. Opening another version's preview in a new tab
3. Comparing the rendered output side-by-side

This helps verify changes before activating a new version.

## API Usage

When using templates via API, version behavior follows these rules:

| Scenario | Version Used |
|----------|--------------|
| No version specified | Active version |
| `template_version: 2` | Version 2 (if exists) |
| Version doesn't exist | Error returned |
| All versions inactive | Error returned |

```javascript
// Get template details including version info
const response = await fetch(
  'https://app.lettr.com/api/templates/order-confirmation',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx'
    }
  }
);

const template = await response.json();
console.log(template.data.version); // Current active version number
```
