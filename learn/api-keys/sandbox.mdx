Sandbox API keys let you test your email integration without sending real emails to actual recipients. Every email sent with a sandbox key is redirected to the account email of the key's creator — regardless of what you specify in the `to`, `cc`, or `bcc` fields.

## How Sandbox Keys Work

When you send an email using a sandbox API key:

1. **Recipients are overridden** — all `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` addresses are replaced with the email address of the user who created the key.
2. **The sender domain is overridden** — the `from` address domain is rewritten to `dev.uselettr.com`, a pre-verified sandbox domain. The local part (before `@`) is preserved.
3. **No domain verification required** — you don't need to set up or verify a sending domain to start testing.
4. **No billing impact** — sandbox sends are free and don't count against your monthly sending quota or daily limits.
5. **Traffic is isolated** — sandbox emails are sent through a dedicated subaccount, fully separated from your live sending traffic.

<Info>
  For example, if you send to `customer@example.com` from `noreply@yourdomain.com`, the sandbox key will actually deliver the email to **your account email** from `noreply@dev.uselettr.com`.
</Info>

<Tip>
  You do **not** need a verified sending domain to use sandbox keys. The sandbox domain `dev.uselettr.com` is already verified and ready to use — you can start sending test emails immediately after creating a sandbox key, even on a brand new account with no domains configured.
</Tip>

## Key Format

Sandbox API keys have a distinct prefix so you can easily identify them:

```
lttr_sandbox_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Live keys use the standard `lttr_` prefix. This makes it easy to spot if a sandbox key is accidentally used in production.

## Creating a Sandbox Key

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** in your dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Local Development", "CI Tests")
4. Select your desired permission level
5. Set the **Type** to **Sandbox**
6. Click **Create**

<Warning>
  Like live keys, the full sandbox API key is only displayed once upon creation. Copy and store it immediately.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

Sandbox keys have stricter rate limits than live keys to prevent abuse:

| Limit | Threshold | Window |
|-|-|-|
| Per-minute | 10 requests | 1 minute |
| Per-day | 100 requests | 24 hours |

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-Sandbox-RateLimit-Minute-Limit: 10
X-Sandbox-RateLimit-Minute-Remaining: 9
X-Sandbox-RateLimit-Day-Limit: 100
X-Sandbox-RateLimit-Day-Remaining: 99
```

When you exceed either limit, the API returns a `429` status code with a `Retry-After` header.

## Allowed Endpoints

Sandbox keys can access email sending and read-only endpoints. Write operations on resources like domains, webhooks, and templates are blocked.

**Allowed:**
- `POST /api/emails` — Send an email
- `GET /api/emails` — List sent emails
- `GET /api/emails/{requestId}` — Get email details
- `GET /api/emails/events` — List email events
- `POST /api/emails/scheduled` — Schedule an email
- `GET /api/emails/scheduled/{transmissionId}` — Get scheduled email details
- `DELETE /api/emails/scheduled/{transmissionId}` — Cancel a scheduled email
- `GET /api/templates` — List templates
- `GET /api/templates/{slug}` — Get template details
- `GET /api/templates/{slug}/merge-tags` — Get template merge tags
- `GET /api/domains` — List domains
- `GET /api/domains/{domain}` — Get domain details
- `GET /api/webhooks` — List webhooks
- `GET /api/webhooks/{webhookId}` — Get webhook details
- `GET /api/auth/check` — Verify API key validity

**Blocked (returns `403`):**
- `POST /api/templates` — Create a template
- `PUT /api/templates/{slug}` — Update a template
- `DELETE /api/templates/{slug}` — Delete a template
- `POST /api/domains` — Create a domain
- `POST /api/domains/{domain}/verify` — Verify a domain
- `DELETE /api/domains/{domain}` — Delete a domain
- `POST /api/webhooks` — Create a webhook
- `PUT /api/webhooks/{webhookId}` — Update a webhook
- `DELETE /api/webhooks/{webhookId}` — Delete a webhook
- `POST /api/sms` — Send SMS
- `POST /api/whatsapp` — Send WhatsApp message

When a sandbox key hits a blocked endpoint, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_code": "sandbox_restricted",
  "message": "Sandbox API keys are restricted to email sending and read-only endpoints."
}
```

## Data Isolation

Sandbox keys enforce strict data isolation:

- **Sent email lists** only show emails sent to the key owner's address
- **Email event lists** are filtered to the key owner's address
- **Scheduled email details** are only accessible if the key owner is a recipient
- **Cancelling scheduled emails** requires the key owner to be a recipient

This means each sandbox key only sees its own test data, even if multiple team members create sandbox keys on the same account.

## Viewing Sandbox Events in the Dashboard

You can view sandbox email events in the dashboard by toggling the **Sandbox** switch on the **Events** page. This filters the event log to show only sandbox traffic for your account.

## Example Usage

Use a sandbox key exactly like a live key. The only difference is the behavior behind the scenes.

```bash
curl https://app.lettr.com/api/emails \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lttr_sandbox_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "noreply@yourdomain.com",
    "to": ["customer@example.com"],
    "subject": "Order Confirmation #1234",
    "html": "<h1>Thank you for your order!</h1>"
  }'
```

The email above will be delivered to **your account email address**, not to `customer@example.com`. The `from` address will be rewritten to `noreply@dev.uselettr.com`.
