description: "Configure API key permissions to control access to Lettr API resources"
---

When creating an API key, you assign a permission level that controls which API endpoints the key can access. Lettr supports two permission levels: **Full Access** and **Sending Only**.

## Permission Levels

### Full Access

Full Access keys provide complete access to all API endpoints and operations:

- Send emails via API
- List and retrieve sent email details
- Access and manage email templates
- Create, verify, and delete sending domains
- Configure and manage webhooks
- List projects

**Use Full Access keys for:**
- Backend services that need complete platform control
- Administrative tools and dashboards
- CI/CD pipelines that manage domains and templates
- Internal tools requiring access to all resources

### Sending Only

Sending Only keys are restricted to email sending operations only. Requests to any other endpoint will be rejected with a `403 Forbidden` response:

```json
{
  "message": "Your API key does not have the required permissions for this action.",
  "error_code": "insufficient_scope"
}
```

**Use Sending Only keys for:**
- Production applications that only send transactional emails
- Third-party integrations that don't need administrative access
- Services where you want to limit the blast radius of a potential key compromise

## Creating Keys with Specific Permissions

### Via the Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Enter a descriptive name
4. Select the permission level:
   - **Full Access** - Complete access to all endpoints
   - **Sending Only** - Restricted to email sending only
5. Configure optional IP restrictions
6. Click **Create**

## IP Restrictions

In addition to permission levels, you can further secure your API keys by restricting them to specific IP addresses. This provides defense in depth — even if a key is compromised, it cannot be used from unauthorized locations.

### Configuring IP Restrictions

When creating or editing an API key, you can specify allowed IP addresses in the **Allowed IPs** field:

```
203.0.113.50, 198.51.100.0/24, 10.0.0.1
```

### Supported Formats

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Single IP | `203.0.113.50` | Allow a single IP address |
| CIDR notation | `198.51.100.0/24` | Allow a range of 256 IPs (198.51.100.0 - 198.51.100.255) |
| Multiple entries | `10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2` | Comma-separated list of IPs or ranges |

### CIDR Notation Reference

| CIDR | IP Range Size | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `/32` | 1 IP | Single host |
| `/24` | 256 IPs | 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255 |
| `/16` | 65,536 IPs | 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255 |
| `/8` | 16,777,216 IPs | 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 |

<Note>
  If no IP restrictions are configured, the API key can be used from any IP address. We recommend configuring IP restrictions for production keys.
</Note>

### IP Restriction Errors

When a request is made from a non-whitelisted IP:

```json
{
  "message": "Access denied. Your IP address is not allowed."
}
```

**HTTP Status**: `403 Forbidden`

## Updating Key Permissions

You can change the permission level of an existing API key at any time:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
2. Click the actions menu (three dots) next to the key
3. Select **Edit**
4. Update the permission level
5. Click **Save**

<Note>
  Permission changes take effect immediately. If you downgrade a key from Full Access to Sending Only, any non-sending API requests using that key will be rejected right away.
</Note>

## Security Recommendations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create separate keys for different environments">
    Use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments. This allows you to revoke keys independently and track usage per environment.

    ```
    Production Web Server - Full Access
    Staging Environment - Full Access
    Development - Full Access
    CI/CD Pipeline - Full Access
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use IP restrictions for production keys">
    For maximum security, restrict production API keys to your server's IP addresses or IP ranges. This adds a layer of protection even if a key is compromised.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audit key usage regularly">
    Review which keys are being used and their access patterns. Revoke any keys that are no longer needed or show suspicious activity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document key purposes">
    Use descriptive names that clearly indicate each key's purpose, environment, and owner. This makes it easier to manage keys over time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Multiple Keys

For larger organizations or complex deployments, consider creating separate keys for:

| Purpose | IP Restrictions |
|---------|-----------------|
| Production email sending | Production server IPs |
| Admin dashboard | Office IP range |
| CI/CD pipeline | CI service IPs |
| Monitoring service | Monitoring service IPs |
| Development testing | None (or developer IPs) |

This approach provides:
- **Isolation**: Compromise of one key doesn't affect others
- **Traceability**: Clear audit trail of which system performed which action
- **Flexibility**: Independent rotation and revocation schedules
