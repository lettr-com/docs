# API Keys

API keys are secret tokens used to authenticate your requests to the Lettr API. They are unique to your account and should be kept confidential.

## Overview

Access your API keys from the [API Keys page](https://app.lettr.com/api-keys) in the dashboard. The page displays all your API keys with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | The descriptive name you gave the key |
| **API Key** | The key value (masked for security, click to copy) |
| **Permissions** | Full access or Sending only |
| **Status** | Active or Inactive |
| **Actions** | Edit or delete the key |

## Create an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open API Keys Page">
    Go to **API Keys** in the dashboard sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click New API Key">
    Click the **+ New API Key** button in the top right.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Key">
    - Enter a descriptive **Name** for the key (e.g., "Production Server", "Marketing App")
    - Select the **Permission** level
    - Optionally, add **Allowed IPs** to restrict access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your Key">
    Copy the API key immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to see the full key again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  For security reasons, you can only view the full API key once when it's created. Store it securely immediately. If you lose the key, you'll need to create a new one.
</Warning>

## Permissions

Lettr offers two permission levels:

| Permission | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Full access** | Grants access to all API endpoints: send emails, manage domains, create API keys, configure webhooks, and more | Backend servers, admin tools |
| **Sending only** | Only allows sending emails via the API | Application servers that only need to send emails |

### Full Access Capabilities

| Category | Capabilities |
|----------|--------------|
| **Emails** | Send emails, view email details, list emails, cancel scheduled emails |
| **Domains** | Add, verify, configure, and delete domains |
| **Templates** | Create, edit, and delete email templates |
| **Webhooks** | Create, configure, and delete webhooks |
| **API Keys** | Create and delete API keys |
| **Analytics** | View all analytics and reports |

### Sending Only Capabilities

| Allowed | Not Allowed |
|---------|-------------|
| Send emails | Manage domains |
| | Manage templates |
| | Manage webhooks |
| | Create/delete API keys |
| | View analytics |

<Tip>
  Use the principle of least privilege. If an application only needs to send emails, use a **Sending only** key. This limits potential damage if the key is compromised.
</Tip>

## IP Restrictions

For enhanced security, you can restrict API key usage to specific IP addresses. This ensures the key only works from your servers.

In the **Allowed IPs** field, enter one or more IP addresses or CIDR ranges:

```
10.20.30.40, 10.20.30.0/24
```

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Single IP | `10.20.30.40` | Allow one specific IP |
| CIDR range | `10.20.30.0/24` | Allow a range of 256 IPs |
| Multiple | `10.20.30.40, 10.20.30.0/24` | Combine with commas |

<Info>
  Leave the **Allowed IPs** field blank to allow access from any IP address.
</Info>

### Common CIDR Examples

| CIDR | IPs Included | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `/32` | 1 IP | Single server |
| `/24` | 256 IPs | Small network |
| `/16` | 65,536 IPs | Large network |

## Edit an API Key

You can update an API key's settings after creation:

1. Find the key in the API Keys list
2. Click the **...** (more options) button in the Actions column
3. Select **Edit API Key**
4. Update the **Name**, **Permissions**, or **Allowed IPs**
5. Click **Save changes**

<Note>
  You cannot view or change the API key value itself after creation. If you need a new key value, create a new API key.
</Note>

## Delete an API Key

To delete an API key:

1. Click the **...** (more options) button for the key
2. Select **Delete API Key**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting an API key is immediate and permanent. Any applications using the key will immediately stop working.
</Warning>

## Using API Keys

### In HTTP Headers

Include the API key in the `Authorization` header using Bearer authentication:

```bash
curl https://app.lettr.com/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from": "hello@example.com", "to": ["user@example.com"], "subject": "Hello"}'
```

### In SDKs

All Lettr SDKs accept the API key during initialization:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
import { Lettr } from 'lettr';

const lettr = new Lettr(process.env.LETTR_API_KEY);
```

```php PHP
use Lettr\Lettr;

$lettr = new Lettr(getenv('LETTR_API_KEY'));
```

```python Python
import os
from lettr import Lettr

lettr = Lettr(os.environ['LETTR_API_KEY'])
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Format

Lettr API keys follow this format:

```
le_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- `le_` prefix identifies it as a Lettr key
- Followed by a 36-character random string

## Best Practices

### Never Expose Keys Client-Side

API keys should **only** be used in server-side code. Never include them in frontend JavaScript, mobile app code, or public repositories.

### Use Environment Variables

Store API keys in environment variables, not in your code:

```bash
# .env file (never commit this!)
LETTR_API_KEY=le_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Use Descriptive Names

Name your API keys descriptively to easily identify their purpose:

| Good Names | Bad Names |
|------------|-----------|
| Production Server | Key 1 |
| Marketing App | Test |
| Staging Environment | API Key |

### Separate Keys for Separate Services

Create distinct API keys for different services. This makes it easy to:
- Identify which service uses which key
- Revoke one key without affecting others
- Filter logs by specific key

### Audit and Rotate Keys

- Regularly review your API keys in the dashboard
- Delete keys that are no longer in use
- Rotate keys periodically, especially after team member departures

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

The API key is missing, invalid, or malformed.

**Check:**
- The key is included in the `Authorization` header
- The format is `Bearer le_xxxxxxxxxxxx` (with space after Bearer)
- The key hasn't been deleted

### 403 Forbidden

The API key is valid but lacks permission for this action.

**Check:**
- The key has the required permission level (Full access vs Sending only)
- If using IP restrictions, your request is coming from an allowed IP
