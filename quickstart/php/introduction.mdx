description: "Send emails from PHP using the Lettr SDK"
---

Send transactional emails from any PHP application using the official Lettr PHP SDK. The SDK provides a clean, type-safe interface for the Lettr API without requiring a specific framework.

The `lettr/lettr-php` package gives you a fluent interface for building and sending emails, managing templates, and tracking delivery — all with full IDE autocompletion and compile-time safety.

Using Cursor? [Jump straight in using this prompt](https://cursor.com/link/prompt?text=Help%20me%20add%20a%20Lettr%20sending%20example%20for%20PHP%20using%20lettr%2Flettr-php%2C%20or%20migrate%20my%20current%20PHP%20sending%20solution%20to%20Lettr.)

## Why Use the PHP SDK?

Rather than making raw HTTP requests, the SDK provides:

- **Type-safe API client** — Full IDE autocompletion and type hints for all methods
- **Fluent email builder** — Chainable methods for constructing complex emails
- **Template support** — Send Lettr-managed templates with merge tags and versioning
- **Error handling** — Typed exceptions for different API errors (validation, auth, not found)
- **Zero dependencies** — Only requires Guzzle HTTP client (which most PHP projects already use)

<Note>
  If you're using Laravel, consider using the framework-specific SDK instead for deeper integration: [Laravel SDK](/quickstart/laravel/introduction)
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Key" icon="key" href="https://app.lettr.com/api-keys">
    Create an API key in the Lettr dashboard
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verified Domain" icon="globe" href="/learn/domains/sending-domains">
    Add and verify your sending domain
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You'll also need:

- **PHP 8.4+** and **Composer** installed
- A verified sending domain in your [Lettr dashboard](https://app.lettr.com/domains)

## Quick Setup

The fastest way to get started is a three-step install, configure, and send process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the package">
    ```bash
    composer require lettr/lettr-php
    ```

    The package requires PHP 8.4+ and Guzzle 7.5+. Composer will install Guzzle automatically if it's not already in your project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a client">
    ```php
    use Lettr\Lettr;

    $lettr = Lettr::client('your-api-key');
    ```

    <Tip>
      Store your API key in environment variables or a config file, never hardcode it. API keys use the `lttr_` prefix followed by 64 hexadecimal characters.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send your first email">
    ```php
    $response = $lettr->emails()->send(
        $lettr->emails()->create()
            ->from('sender@yourdomain.com', 'Your App')
            ->to(['recipient@example.com'])
            ->subject('Hello from Lettr')
            ->html('<h1>Hello!</h1><p>This is a test email.</p>')
    );

    echo $response->requestId; // Request ID for tracking
    echo $response->accepted;  // Number of accepted recipients
    ```

    The builder pattern lets you chain methods to construct your email. All emails require `from`, `to`, `subject`, and at least one content type (`html`, `text`, or a template).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The sender domain must be verified in your [Lettr dashboard](https://app.lettr.com/domains) before you can send emails. If you try to send from an unverified domain, the API returns a `422` validation error. See [Sending Domains](/learn/domains/sending-domains) for setup instructions.
</Warning>

## Verify Your API Key

Test that your API key is valid before sending emails:

```php
$auth = $lettr->health()->authCheck();

echo $auth->teamId; // Your team ID
```

If no exception is thrown, you're authenticated and ready to send emails. This check verifies that your API key is correctly formatted, active, and has permission to access your team's resources.

<Tip>
  During development, use the health check endpoint to catch configuration issues early. It's a quick way to verify your setup before attempting to send emails.
</Tip>

## Using a Framework?

If you're working within a specific PHP framework, these integrations provide deeper integration:

    Use SMTP instead of the HTTP API
