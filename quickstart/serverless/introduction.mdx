description: "Send emails from serverless functions with Lettr"
---

Deploy email sending on serverless platforms. Lettr's REST API works seamlessly with serverless functions — no persistent connections or background workers needed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A Lettr account — [sign up at app.lettr.com](https://app.lettr.com)
2. An [API key](/learn/api-keys/introduction) created in your dashboard
3. A [verified sending domain](/learn/domains/introduction)

## Why Lettr Works Well with Serverless

Serverless functions are stateless and short-lived, which makes SMTP connections impractical. Lettr's HTTP API is ideal for serverless environments because:

- **No connection pooling** — Each request is independent, no persistent SMTP connections needed
- **Fast cold starts** — A single HTTP call is all it takes to send an email
- **Built-in retries** — Lettr handles delivery retries, so your function doesn't need to
- **Async by design** — Fire-and-forget sending keeps function execution time short

## Generic Example

On any serverless platform, sending email is a single HTTP POST:

```javascript
export async function handler(event) {
  const response = await fetch('https://app.lettr.com/api/emails', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.LETTR_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      from: 'you@yourdomain.com',
      to: ['recipient@example.com'],
      subject: 'Hello from Lettr',
      html: '<p>Sent from a serverless function!</p>',
    }),
  });

  return { statusCode: response.status };
}
```

<Tip>
  Store your API key in environment variables or your platform's secrets manager — never hardcode it in your function source.
