Lettr rate limits API requests to ensure fair usage across all customers. In addition to request-level rate limits, the Send Email endpoint returns quota headers that track your daily and monthly email usage.

## Rate Limit

The default rate limit is **3 requests per second** per team, shared across all API keys belonging to the same team. If you exceed the limit, subsequent requests return `429 Too Many Requests` until the window resets.

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit headers:

| Header | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | `integer` | Maximum number of requests allowed per second. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | `integer` | How many requests you have left in the current window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | `integer` | Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the rate limit window resets. |
| `Retry-After` | `integer` | How many seconds to wait before retrying. Only present on `429` responses. |

## Sending Quota Headers

The [Send Email](/api-reference/emails/send-email) endpoint returns additional headers that track your email sending quotas. These headers are present for **free tier** teams.

### Daily Quota

| Header | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `X-Daily-Limit` | `integer` | Maximum number of emails you can send per day. |
| `X-Daily-Remaining` | `integer` | How many emails you have left today. |
| `X-Daily-Reset` | `integer` | Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the daily counter resets (midnight UTC). |

### Monthly Quota

| Header | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `X-Monthly-Limit` | `integer` | Maximum number of emails you can send per billing month. |
| `X-Monthly-Remaining` | `integer` | How many emails you have left this month. |
| `X-Monthly-Reset` | `integer` | Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the monthly counter resets (start of next billing month). |

## Error Codes

When you exceed a limit, the API returns a `429` response with one of these error codes:

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many API requests. Slow down and retry after the `Retry-After` period. |
| `daily_quota_exceeded` | Daily sending quota exceeded (free tier). Try again after midnight UTC. |
| `quota_exceeded` | Monthly sending quota exceeded. Upgrade your plan to continue sending. |
