title: Update Template
openapi: PUT /templates/{slug}
---

Updates an existing template by its slug. You can update the template name, project assignment, or content. Providing new `html` or `json` content creates a new version of the template automatically.

The `html` and `json` fields are mutually exclusive. If neither is provided, only metadata (name, project) is updated without creating a new version.
