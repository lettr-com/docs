title: Delete Template
openapi: DELETE /templates/{slug}
---

Permanently deletes a template and all of its versions. This action cannot be undone. Any future [Send Email](/api-reference/emails/send-email) calls referencing this template's slug will fail.

Use the `project_id` query parameter if you have templates with the same slug across different projects.
